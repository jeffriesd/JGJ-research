This paper considers parametricity and its consequent free theorems
for nested data types. Rather than representing nested types via their
Church encodings in a higher-kinded or dependently typed extension of
System F, we adopt a functional programming perspective and design a
Hindley-Milner-style calculus with primitives for constructing nested
types directly as fixpoints. Our type system appears to be the first
in the 20+ years since nested types were first introduced to treat
them as explicit fixpoints. It can express all nested types appearing
in the literature, including truly nested types. At the term-level,
our calculus supports primitive pattern matching, map functions, and
fold combinators for nested types. Our main contribution is the
construction of a parametric model for our calculus. This is both
delicate and challenging. In particular, to ensure the existence of
semantic fixpoints interpreting nested types, and thus to establish a
suitable Identity Extension Lemma for our calculus, our type system
must explicitly track functoriality of types, and cocontinuity
conditions on the functors interpreting them must be appropriately
threaded throughout the model construction. We show that the
resulting model verifies all standard consequences of parametricity in
the presence of primitive nested types.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\vspace*{-0.1in}

{\em Algebraic data types} (ADTs), both built-in and user-defined,
have long been at the core of functional languages such as Haskell,
ML, Agda, Epigram, and Idris. ADTs, like that of natural numbers, can
be unindexed. But they can also be indexed over other types. For
example, the ADT of lists (here coded in Agda)

{\small
\[\begin{array}{l}
\mathtt{data\; List \;(A : Set)\;:\;Set\;where}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{nil\;:\; List\;A}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{cons\;:\;A \rightarrow List\;A \rightarrow List\;A}
\end{array}\]}

\noindent
is indexed over its element type $\mathtt{A}$.  The instance of
$\List$ at index $\mathtt{A}$ depends only on itself, and so is
independent of $\mathtt{List\,B}$ for any other index $\mathtt{B}$.
That is, $\mathtt{List}$, like all other ADTs, defines a {\em family
  of inductive types}, one for each index type.

Over time, there has been a notable trend toward data types whose
non-regular indexing can capture invariants and other sophisticated
properties that can be used for program verification {\color{blue} and
  other applications~\cite{}.}  A simple example of such a type is
given by Bird and Meertens'~\cite{bm98} prototypical nested type
\[\begin{array}{l}
\mathtt{data\; PTree\;(A : Set)\;:\;Set\;where}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{pleaf\;:\;A \rightarrow PTree\;A}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{pnode\;:\;PTree\;(A \times A) \rightarrow PTree\;A}
\end{array}\]
\noindent
of perfect trees, which can be thought of as constraining lists to
have lengths that are powers of 2.  The above code makes clear that
perfect trees at index type $\mathtt{A}$ are defined in terms of
perfect trees at index type $\mathtt{A \times A}$. This is typical of
nested types, one type instance of which can depend on others, so that
the entire family of types must actually be defined at once. A nested
type thus defines not a family of inductive types, but rather an {\em
  inductive family of types}.
%(Of course, every ADT can trivially be viewed as a nested type.)
Nested types include simple nested types, like perfect trees, none of
whose recursive occurrences occur below another type constructor;
``deep'' nested types~\cite{jp20}, such as the nested type {\small
\[\begin{array}{l}
\mathtt{data\; PForest\;(A : Set)\;:\;Set\;where}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{fempty\;:\;PForest\;A}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{fnode\;:\; A \rightarrow PTree\;(PForest\;A) \to
PForest\;A}
\end{array}\]}
\hspace{-0.04in}of perfect forests, whose recursive occurrences appear
below type constructors for other nested types; and truly nested
types\footnote{Nested types that are defined over themselves are known
  as {\em truly nested types}.}, such as the nested type {\small
\[\begin{array}{l}
\mathtt{data\; Bush\;(A : Set)\;:\;Set\;where}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{bnil\;:\; Bush\;A}\\
\hspace*{0.4in}\mathtt{bcons\;:\;A \rightarrow Bush\;(Bush \; A)
  \rightarrow Bush\;A} 
\end{array}\]}
\hspace{-0.04in}of bushes,
%(also called {\em bootstrapped heaps} in~\cite{oka99}),
whose recursive occurrences appear below their own type constructors.

{\em Relational parametricity} encodes a powerful notion of
type-uniformity, or representation independence, for data types in
polymorphic languages. It formalizes the intuition that a polymorphic
program must act uniformly on all of its possible type instantiations
by requiring that every such program preserves all relations between
any pair of types at which it is instantiated. Parametricity was
originally put forth by Reynolds~\cite{rey83} for System
F~\cite{gir72}, the calculus at the core of all polymorphic functional
languages. It was later popularized as Wadler's ``theorems for
free''~\cite{wad89}, so called because it can deduce properties of
programs in such languages solely from their types, i.e., with no
knowledge whatsoever of the text of the programs involved.
%To get interesting free theorems, Wadler's calculus included the
%above list ADT; indeed, most of his
Most of Wadler's free theorems are consequences of naturality for
polymorphic list-processing functions. However, he also shows that
parametricity can derive
%derive naturality properties for non-list ADTs,
results, like correctness for lists of the program optimization known
as {\em short cut fusion}~\cite{glp93}, that go beyond just
naturality.

But what about nested types? Does parametricity still hold if such
types are added to polymorphic calculi? More practically, can we
justifiably reason type-independently about (functions over) nested
types in functional languages?

Type-independent reasoning about ADTs in functional languages is
usually justified by first representing ADTs by their Church
encodings, and then reasoning type-independently about these
encodings. This is typically justified by constructing a parametric
model --- i.e, a model in which polymorphic functions preserve
relations {\em \'a la} Reynolds --- for a suitable fragment of System
F, demonstrating that an initial algebra exists for the positive type
constructor corresponding to the functor underlying every ADT, and
showing that each such initial algebra is suitably isomorphic to its
corresponding Church encoding. In fact, this isomorphism of initial
algebras and their Church encodings is one of the ``litmus tests'' for
the goodness of a parametric model.

This approach works well for ADTs, which are always fixpoints of {\em
  first-order} functors, and whose Church encodings, which involve
quantification over only type variables, are always expressible in
System F. For example, $\mathtt{List\,A}$ is the fixpoint of the
first-order functor $\mathtt{F\,X = 1 + A \times X}$ and has Church
encoding $\forall \alpha. \, \alpha \to (\mathtt{A} \to \alpha \to
\alpha) \to \alpha$. But despite Cardelli's~\cite{car97} claim that
``virtually any basic type of interest can be encoded within F$_2$''
--- i.e., within System F ---
%type-independent reasoning via Church encodings is not possible
%for nested types in System F for the simple reason that
non-ADT nested types cannot.
%are not, in general, expressible there.
Not even our prototypical nested type of perfect trees has a Church
encoding expressible in System F!  Indeed, $\mathtt{PTree\,A}$ cannot
be represented as the fixpoint of any {\em first-order}
functor. However, it can be seen as the instance at index $\mathtt{A}$
of the fixpoint of the {\em higher-order} functor
$\mathtt{H\,F\,A\,=\, (A \to F\,A) \to (F \,(A \times A) \to F\,A) \to
  F\,A}$. It thus has Church encoding $\forall f.\, (\forall
\alpha.\,\alpha \to f\alpha) \to (\forall \alpha. \,f (\alpha \times
\alpha) \to f\alpha) \to \forall \alpha.\, f\alpha$, which requires
quantification at the higher kind $* \to *$ for $f$. A similar
situation obtains for any (non-ADT) nested type. Unfortunately,
higher-kinded quantification is not available in System F, so if we
want to reason type-independently about nested types in a language
based on it we have only two options: {\em i})\,move to an extension
of System F, such as the higher-kinded calculus $F\omega$ or a
dependent type theory, and reason via their Church encodings in a
known parametric model for that extension, or {\em ii})\, add nested
types to System F as primitives --- i.e., as primitive type-level
fixpoints --- and construct a parametric model for the resulting
calculus.

Since the type systems of $F\omega$ and dependent type theories are
designed to extend System F with far more than non-ADT data types, it
seems like serious overkill to pass to their parametric models to
reason about nested types in System F. Indeed, such calculi support
essential features that add complexity to their models that is
entirely unnecessary for reasoning about nested types. This paper
therefore pursues the second option above.  We first design a
Hindley-Milner-style calculus supporting primitive nested types,
%directly as fixpoints
together with primitive types of natural transformations representing
morphisms between such types.  Although nested types were introduced
more than 20 years ago, our type system appears to be the first to
treat them as explicit fixpoints. Our calculus can express all nested
types appearing in the literature, including truly nested types.  At
the term-level, it supports primitive pattern matching, map functions,
and fold combinators for nested types.\footnote{We do not address
  general term-level recursion in this paper in part because, as
  Pitts~\cite{pit00} reminds us, ``it is hard to construct models of
  both impredicative polymorphism and fixpoint recursion'', and in
  part because constructing a parametric model even for a predicative
  calculus with primitive nested type is already rather involved.
%  Our
%  strongly normalizing calculus may be what was sought
%  in~\cite{wad89}.} 
  On the other hand, our calculus is strongly normalizing, so it
  perhaps edges us toward the kind of provably total practical
  programming language proposed in~\cite{wad89}.}  Our main
contribution is the construction of a parametric model for our
calculus. This is both delicate and challenging. To ensure the
existence of semantic fixpoints interpreting nested types, and thus to
establish a suitable Identity Extension Lemma, our type system must
explicitly track functoriality of types, and cocontinuity conditions
on the functors interpreting them must be appropriately threaded
throughout the model construction. Our model validates all standard
consequences of parametricity --- including Wadler's free theorems ---
for primitive nested types, as well as the isomorphism of primitive
ADTs and their Church encodings. The relationship between naturality
and parametricity has long been of interest, and our inclusion of a
primitive type of natural transformations allows us to clearly
delineate those consequences of parametricity
%--- e.g.,
%if a nested type is rearrangeable in a type-independent way then
%rearranging after mapping is the same as mapping after rearranging ---
that follow from naturality,
%and may thus hold even in non-parametric models,
from those, such as short cut fusion for nested types, that
require the full power of parametricity.

\noindent
{\bf Structure of this Paper}\/ We introduce our calculus in
Section~\ref{sec:calculus}.  Its type system is based on the
level-2-truncation of the higher-kinded grammar from~\cite{jp19},
augmented with a primitive type of natural
transformations. (Since~\cite{jp19} contains no term calculus, the
issue of parametricity could not even be raised there.)  In
Section~\ref{sec:type-interp} we give set and relational
interpretations of our types. Set interpretations are possible
precisely because our calculus is predicative --- as ensured by our
primitive natural transformation types --- and~\cite{jp19} guarantees
that local finite presentability of $\set$ makes it suitable for
interpreting nested types.  As is standard in categorical models,
types are interpreted as functors from environments interpreting their
type variable contexts to sets or relations, as appropriate. To ensure
that these functors satisfy the cocontinuity properties needed for the
semantic fixpoints interpreting $\mu$-types to exist, set environments
must map $k$-ary type constructor variables to appropriately
cocontinuous $k$-ary functors on sets, relation environments must map
$k$-ary type constructor variables to appropriately cocontinuous
$k$-ary relation transformers, and these cocontinuity conditions must
be threaded through our type interpretations in such a way that an
Identity Extension Lemma (Theorem~\ref{thm:iel}) can be
proved. Properly propagating the cocontinuity conditions requires
considerable care, and Section~\ref{sec:iel}, where it is done, is
(apart from tracking functoriality in the calculus so that it is
actually possible) where the bulk of the work in constructing our
model lies.

In Section~\ref{sec:term-interp}, we give set and relational
interpretations for the terms of our calculus. As usual in categorical
models, terms are interpreted as natural transformations from
interpretations of their term contexts to interpretations of their
types, and these must cohere in what is essentially a fibred
way.
%Immediately from the definitions of our interpretations
In Section~\ref{sec:Nat-type-terms} we prove
%in Section~\ref{sec:Nat-type-terms}
a scheme deriving free theorems that are consequences of naturality of
polymorphic functions over nested types. This scheme is very general,
is parameterized over both the data type and the type of the
polymorphic function at hand. It has, for example, analogues for
nested types of Wadler's map-rearrangement free theorems as
instances. In Section~\ref{sec:thms} we prove that our model satisfies
an Abstraction Theorem (Theorem~\ref{thm:abstraction}), and use it to
derive other parametricity results that go beyond naturality in
Section~\ref{sec:ftnt}. Specifically, we state and prove
(non-)inhabitation results in Sections~\ref{sec:bottom}
and~\ref{sec:identity}, a free theorem for the type of a filter
function on generalized rose trees in Section~\ref{sec:ft-adt}, and
correctness of a generalization of short cut fusion to
%lists in Section~\ref{sec:short-cut}, and its generalization to
nested types in Section~\ref{sec:short-cut-nested}. 

\noindent
{\bf Related Work}\/
There is a long line of work on categorical models of parametricity
for System F; see,
e.g.,~\cite{bfss90,bm05,dr04,gjfor15,has94,jac99,mr92,rr94}.  To our
knowledge, all such models treat ADTs via their Church encodings,
verifying in the
%Much of this work does ultimately extend parametricity to data types
%that are modeled as fixpoints of first-order functors, but to our
%knowledge this has never been done by building the data types directly
%into the calculus whose parametricity is to be modeled
%categorically. Indeed, all extensions we know of use the categorical
%equivalent of Atkey's approach. That is, they verify in the
just-constructed parametric model that

%fixpoint of the (first-order) functor interpreting the type
%constructor from which it was constructed.
%This is the categorical analogue of the approach in~\cite{atk12}
%described above.
The present paper draws on this rich tradition of categorical models
of parametricity for System F, but modifies them to treat nested types
(and therefore ADTs) as primitive data types.
%, and necessarily does so by direct construction as fixpoints
%rather than by Church encodings.
%This requires that we

%%System F's full impredicative polymorphism interacts reasonably with

%design our calculus in such a way that its types all have
%interpretations as appropriately cocontinuous functors, so that the

%
%parametricity to primitive nested types {\em as the model is being
%constructed} by taking care to ensure that System F's full
%impredicative polymorphism does not interfere with the functoriality

The only other extensions we know of System F with primitive data
types are those in~\cite{mat11,mg01,pit98,pit00,wad89}.
Wadler~\cite{wad89} treats full System F, and sketches parametricity
for its extension with lists. Martin and Gibbons~\cite{mg01} outline a
semantics for a grammar of primitive nested types similar to that
in~\cite{jp19}, but treat only polynomial nested types, i.e., nested
types that are fixpoints of polynomial higher-order
functors. Unfortunately, the model suggested in~\cite{mg01} is not
entirely correct (see~\cite{jp19}), and parametricity is nowhere
mentioned.  Matthes~\cite{mat11} treats System F with non-polynomial
ADTs and nested types, but his focus is on expressivity of generalized
Mendler iteration for them. He gives no semantics.
%In including primitive data types our calculus is similar in spirit
%to Pitts' PolyFix~\cite{pit00}.

In~\cite{pit00}, Pitts adds list ADTs to full System F with a
term-level fixpoint primitive. Other ADTs are included
in~\cite{pit98}, but nested types are not expressible in either
syntax.
%The parametric model Pitts constructs is also operational
%rather than categorical, as is ours,
%Part of Pitts' motivation is to show that ADTs and their Church
%encodings have the same operational behavior in his calculus. We
%cannot even ask this question about our calculus {\color{red} in H-M
%systems?}, which cannot express Church encodings of even simple ADTs
%such as list, or pair, or sum types, since these are not functorial;
%nevertheless, we do prove the correctness of short cut fusion for
%nested types, whose operational analogue is valid in the parametric
%model Pitts constructs and is the means by which he proves his
%equivalence result.
%
%One direction for future work is to determine what operational
%analogues of functoriality and cocontinuity are needed to extend
%Pitts' models to full System F with term-level fixpoints and primitive
%nested types.
%
%from a calculus with primitives for constructing
%data types modeled as fixpoints of first-order functors to one that
%also provides such primitives for data types modeled as fixpoints of
%higher-order functors.
Pitts constructs parametric models for his calculi based on their
operational semantics.  One benefit using operational, rather than
categorical, semantics to build parametric models is that it avoids
needing to work in a suitable metatheory to accommodate System F's
impredicativity. It is well-known that there are no set-based
parametric models of System F~\cite{rey84}, so parametric models for
it and its extensions are often constructed in a syntactic metatheory
such as the impredicative Calculus of Inductive Constructions (iCIC).
By adding primitive nested types to a Hindley-Milner-style calculus
and working in a categorical setting we side-step such metatheoretic
distractions. It is important to note that different consequences of
parametricity are available in syntactic and semantic
metatheories. Consequences of parametricity are possible for both
closed and open System F terms in a syntactic metatheory --- although
not all that can be formulated can be always proved; see, e.g., the
end of Section~7 of~\cite{bm98}. By contrast, in a categorical
metatheory consequences of parametricity are expressible only for {\em
  closed} terms. For this reason, validating the standard consequences
of parametricity for closed terms is --- going all the way back to
Reynolds~\cite{rey83} --- all that is required for a model of
parametricity to be considered good.

%We are not the first to consider parametricity at higher kinds. For
%example, Vytiniotis and Weirich~\cite{vw10} give an operational
%semantics for an extension of System $F_\omega$ with representation
%types.
Atkey~\cite{atk12} treats parametricity for arbitrary higher kinds,
constructing a parametric model for System F$_\omega$ within iCIC,
rather than in a semantic category. His construction is in some ways
similar to ours, but he represents (now higher-kinded) data types
using Church encodings rather than as primitives. Moreover, the
$\mathit{fmap}$ functions associated to Atkey's functors must be {\em
  given}, presumably by the programmer, together with their underlying
type constructors, which absolves him of imposing cocontinuity
conditions on his model to ensure that fixpoints of his functors
exist.  Unfortunately, Atkey does not indicate which type constructors
support $\mathit{fmap}$ functions, and we suspect explicitly spelling
out which types can be interpreted as strictly positive functors would
result in a full higher-kinded extension of a calculus such as that
presented here.


%To construct
%nested types, we carefully build up functorial type expressions not
%just from standard type variables, but also from type constructor
%variables; we also include an explicit $\mu$-construct to represent
%initial sequence constructions for functors in these variables. The
%class of nested types representable in our calculus includes all
%(truly) nested types known from the literature.
%Our primitive natural
%transformation types serve the double purpose of ensuring that our
%calculus is predicative.
%At the term level, our calculus includes primitive constructs for the
%actions on morphisms of the functors interpreting types, initial
%algebras for fixpoints of these functors, and structured recursion
%over elements of these initial algebras (i.e., $\map$, $\tin$, and
%$\mathsf{fold}$ constructs, respectively).

\vspace*{-0.07in}

\subsection{Types}
For each $k \ge 0$, we assume countable sets $\tvars^k$ of \emph{type
  constructor variables of arity $k$} and $\fvars^k$ of
\emph{functorial variables of arity $k$}, all mutually disjoint.
%disjoint for distinct $k$ and disjoint from each other.
The sets of all type constructor variables and functorial variables
are $\tvars = \bigcup_{k \ge 0} \tvars^k$ and $\fvars = \bigcup_{k \ge
  0} \fvars^k$, respectively, and a \emph{type variable} is any
element of $\tvars \cup \fvars$.  We use lower case Greek letters for
type variables, writing $\phi^k$ to indicate that $\phi \in \tvars^k
\cup \fvars^k$, and omitting the arity indicator $k$ when convenient.
Letters from the beginning of the alphabet denote type variables of
arity $0$, i.e., elements of $\tvars^0 \cup \fvars^0$. We write
$\overline{\zeta}$ for either a set $\{\zeta_1,...,\zeta_n\}$ of type
constructor variables or a set of functorial variables when the
cardinality $n$ of the set is unimportant or clear from context. If
$\Pos\,$ is a set of type variables we write $\Pos, \overline{\phi}$
for $\Pos\, \cup \overline{\phi}$ when $\Pos\, \cap \overline{\phi} =
\emptyset$.  We omit the vector notation for a singleton set, thus
writing $\phi$, instead of $\overline{\phi}$, for $\{\phi\}$.

%\begin{definition}
%Let $V$ be a finite subset of\, $\tvars$, $\Pos$ be a finite
%subset of\, $\fvars$, $\overline{\alpha}$ be a finite subset of\,
%$\fvars^0$ disjoint from $\Pos$, and $\phi^k \in \fvars^k
%\setminus \Pos$.  The set $\mcF^\Pos(V)$ of {\em functorial
%  expressions} over $\Pos$ and $V$ are given by
%\begin{align*}
%  \mcF^\Pos(V) \; ::= \; %\T(V)
%  & \hspace*{0.15in}
%\zerot \mid \onet 
%\mid \Nat^{\ol{\alpha}} \, \mcF^{\overline{\alpha}}(V) \;
%\mcF^{\ol{\alpha}}(V) %\mid V \ol{\T(V)}
%\mid \Pos\; \ol{\mcF^\Pos(V)}  \,
%\mid V\, \ol{\mcF^\Pos(V)}  
%\mid \mcF^{\Pos}(V) + \mcF^\Pos(V)\\
%&\mid \mcF^{\Pos}(V) \times \mcF^\Pos(V) \mid \left(\mu
%\phi^{~k}. \lambda \alpha_1...\alpha_k.  
%\mcF^{\Pos,\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k,\phi}(V)\right)
%  \ol{\mcF^{\Pos}(V)}
%\end{align*}
%\end{definition}
%\noindent
%A \emph{type} over $\Pos$ and $V$ is any element of % $\T(V) \cup
%$\F^\Pos(V)$.

If $V$ is a finite subset of\, $\tvars$, $\Pos$ is a finite subset
of\, $\fvars$, $\overline{\alpha}$ is a finite subset of\, $\fvars^0$
disjoint from $\Pos$, and $\phi^k \in \fvars^k \setminus \Pos$, then
the well-formed types over $V$ and $\Pos$ are given in
Definition~\ref{def:wftypes}.  The notation there entails that type
application $\phi F_1...F_k$ is allowed only when $\phi$ is a type
variable of arity $k$, or $\phi$ is a subexpression of the form $\mu
\psi^{k}.\lambda \alpha_1...\alpha_k.F'$. Moreover, if $\phi$ has
arity $k$ then $\phi$ must be applied to exactly $k$ arguments.
Accordingly, an overbar indicates a sequence of subexpressions whose
length matches the arity of the type applied to it. Requiring that
types are always \emph{$\eta$-long normal form} avoids having to
consider $\beta$-conversion at the level of types. In a subexpression
$\Nat^{\ol{\alpha}}F\,G$, the $\Nat$ operator binds all occurrences of
the variables in $\ol{\alpha}$ in $F$ and $G$; intuitively, $\Nat^{\ol
  \alpha}F\,G$ represents the type of a natural transformation in $\ol
\alpha$ from the functor $F$ to the functor $G$. In a subexpression
  $\mu \phi^k.\lambda \ol{\alpha}.F$, the $\mu$ operator binds all
  occurrences of the variable $\phi$, and the $\lambda$ operator binds
  all occurrences of the variables in $\ol{\alpha}$, in the body $F$.

A {\em type constructor context} is a finite set $\Gamma$ of type
constructor variables, and a {\em functorial context} is a finite set
$\Phi$ of functorial variables. In Definition~\ref{def:wftypes}, a
judgment of the form $\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F$ indicates that the
type $F$ is intended to be functorial in the variables in $\Phi$
but not necessarily in those in $\Gamma$.
\begin{definition}\label{def:wftypes}

  \tvars, \Pos\, \subseteq \fvars}\F^\Pos(V)$ of\, {\em well-formed

%A type $\tau$ is {\em well-formed} if it is
%either a well-formed type constructor expression or a
%well-formed functorial expression.
\end{definition}
If $F$ is a closed type we write $\vdash F$ for $\emptyset;\emptyset
\vdash F$.  Definition~\ref{def:wftypes} ensures that the expected
weakening rules for well-formed types hold, although weakening does
not change the contexts in which types can be formed. If
$\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash F$ and $\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash G$, then our
rules allow formation of the type $\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash
\Nat^\emptyset F \,G$.
%Since $\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\ol
%  \alpha}F\,G$ represents the type of a natural transformation in $\ol
%\alpha$ from $F$ to $G$,
Note that the type $\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset F \,G$
represents the arrow type $\Gamma \vdash F \to G$ in our calculus and
the type $\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\ol\alpha} \,\onet \,F$
represents the $\forall$-type $\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \forall
\ol\alpha . F$.  Note also that
%not even all
%Hindley-Milner types of System F are representable in our calculus.
not all System F types are 
%only those System F types that can be interpreted as functors are
representable in our calculus. For example, the type $\forall
\alpha. (\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha$ is not representable.
%
%However, if $\ol\alpha$ is non-empty then $\tau$ cannot be of the
%form $\Nat^{\ol\beta} H \, K$ since $\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash
%\Nat^{\ol\beta} H \, K$ is not a valid type judgment in our calculus
%(except by weakening).

Definition~\ref{def:wftypes} supports the representation of all of the
(closed) nested types from the introduction. Indeed, $\mathit{List}\,
\alpha \; = \; \mu \beta. \,\onet + \alpha \times \beta\; = \; (\mu
\phi. \lambda \beta.\,\onet + \beta \times \phi \beta)\,\alpha$,\,
$\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha \; = \; (\mu \phi. \lambda \beta.\,\beta +
\phi\,(\beta \times \beta))\,\alpha$, \, $\mathit{PForest}\,\alpha \;
= \; (\mu \phi. \lambda \beta. \,\onet + \beta \times
\mathit{PTree}\,(\phi \beta))\,\alpha$, and $\mathit{Bush}\,\alpha \;
= \; (\mu \phi.\lambda \beta. \,\onet + \beta \times
\phi\,(\phi\beta))\,\alpha$.
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
%\mathit{List}\, \alpha & = & \mu \beta. \,\onet + \alpha \times
%\beta\; = \; (\mu \phi. \lambda \beta.\,\onet + \beta \times \phi
%\beta)\,\alpha\\ 
%\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha & = & (\mu \phi. \lambda \beta.\,\beta +
%\phi\,(\beta \times \beta))\,\alpha\\
%\mathit{PForest}\,\alpha & = & (\mu \phi. \lambda \beta. \,\onet +
%\beta \times \mathit{PTree}\,(\phi \beta))\,\alpha\\ 
%\mathit{Bush}\,\alpha & = & (\mu \phi.\lambda \beta. \,\onet + \beta
%\times \phi\,(\phi\beta))\,\alpha 
%\end{array}\]
Each of these types can be considered either functorial in $\alpha$ or
not, according to whether $\alpha$ is in the functorial or
non-functorial context in which it is formed. In particular, if
$\emptyset;\alpha \vdash \mathit{List} \,\alpha$, then $\vdash
\Nat^\alpha \onet\, (\mathit{List}\,\alpha)$ is well-formed; if
$\alpha;\emptyset \vdash \List \,\alpha$, then it is not.  Similarly,
if $\mathit{Tree}\,\alpha\,\gamma = \mu \,\beta.\, \alpha + \beta
\times \gamma \times \beta$, then $\gamma;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha
(\mathit{List}\, \alpha) \, (\mathit{Tree} \, \alpha\, \gamma)$ is
well-formed, but $\emptyset;\gamma \vdash \Nat^\alpha (\mathit{List}\,
\alpha) \, (\mathit{Tree} \, \alpha\, \gamma)$ is not. Although types
can be functorial in variables of arity greater than $0$, the body $F$
of a type $(\mu \phi.\lambda \ol\alpha.F)\,\ol G$ cannot. For example,
the type $\mathit{GRose}\, \phi \, \alpha = \mu\beta . \alpha \times
\phi \beta$ can be functorial or not in $\alpha$, but cannot be
functorial in $\phi$. In addition, $\mathit{GRose}\,\phi\,\alpha$
cannot be the (co)domain of a $\Nat$ type representing a natural
transformation functorial in $\phi$, and the type $\mu \phi. \lambda
\alpha. \mathit{GRose}\,\phi\,\alpha$ is not well-formed in our
system. These restrictions ensure that the set and relational
interpretations of types in Section~\ref{sec:type-interp} are
$\omega$-cocontinuous functors: for example, the type $\emptyset;
\alpha \vdash \Nat^\emptyset \, N \, \alpha$, where $N = \mu
\alpha. \,1 + \alpha$, is functorial in $\alpha$, but will not have an
interpretation as an $\omega$-cocontinuous functor~\cite{jp19}.
%In particular,
%this means that extra variables cannot be permitted in the codomains
%of $\Nat$-types.
%In Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we
%consider approaches to accommodating more expressive types.

Definition~\ref{def:wftypes} allows well-formed types to be functorial
in no variables. Functorial variables can also be demoted to
non-functorial status: if $F[\phi :== \psi]$ is the textual
replacement of $\phi$ in $F$, then $\Gamma, \psi^k; \Phi \vdash
F[\phi^k :== \psi^k]$ is derivable whenever $\Gamma; \Phi, \phi^k
\vdash F$ is.
%\begin{lemma}
%If\, $\Gamma; \Phi, \phi^k \vdash F$, then $\Gamma, \psi^k; \Phi
%\vdash F[\phi^k :== \psi^k]$ is also derivable. Here, $F[\phi :==
%  \psi]$ is the textual replacement of $\phi$ in $F$, meaning that all
%occurrences of $\phi\ol\sigma$ in $F$ become $\psi\ol\sigma$.
%\end{lemma}
The proof is by induction on the structure of $F$.  In addition to
textual replacement, we also have a proper substitution operation on
types. If $F$ is a type over $P$ and $V$, if $\Pos$ and $V$ contain
only type variables of arity $0$, and if $k=0$ for every occurrence of
$\phi^k$ bound by $\mu$ in $F$, then we say that $F$ is {\em
  first-order}; otherwise we say that $F$ is {\em second-order}.
Substitution for first-order types is the usual capture-avoiding
textual substitution. We write $F[\alpha := \sigma]$ for the result of
substituting $\sigma$ for $\alpha$ in $F$, and $F[\alpha_1 :=
  F_1,...,\alpha_k := F_k]$, or $F[\ol{\alpha := F}]$ when convenient,
for $F[\alpha_1 := F_1][\alpha_2 := F_2,...,\alpha_k := F_k]$. The
operation $(\cdot)[\phi :=_{\ol \alpha} F]$ of {\em second-order type
  substitution along $\ol\alpha$} is defined by induction on types
exactly as expected.
\begin{comment} Substitution for second-order types is given below, using
  similar notations for vectors of types. Note that it is not correct
  to substitute along non-functorial variables.
\begin{definition}\label{def:second-order-subst}
 The operation $(\cdot)[\phi :=_{\ol \alpha} F]$ of {\em second-order
   type substitution along $\ol\alpha$} is defined by:
\[\begin{array}{lll}
\zerot[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] & = & \zerot\\[0.5ex]
\onet[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] & = & \onet\\[0.25ex]

(\psi\ol{G})[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] & = &
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\psi \,\ol{G[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F]} & \mbox{if } \psi \not = \phi\\
  F[\ol{\alpha  := G[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F]}] 
  & \mbox{if } \psi = \phi
\end{array}\right.\\[2.8ex]
(G + K)[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] & = & G[\phi
  :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] + K[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F]\\[0.5ex] 
(G \times K)[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] & = &
G[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F] \times K[\phi
  :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F]\\[0.5ex]   
((\mu \psi. \lambda \ol{\beta}.\, G)\ol{K})[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}}
  F] & = & (\mu \psi. \lambda \ol{\beta}. \,G[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}}
  F])\, \ol{K[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F]}
\end{array}\]
\end{definition}
\noindent
\end{comment}
Of course, $(\cdot)[\phi^0 :=_\emptyset F]$ coincides with
first-order substitution. We omit $\ol\alpha$ when convenient, but
note that it is not correct to substitute along non-functorial
variables. It is not hard to see that if \,$\Gamma; \Phi,\phi^k
\vdash H$ and\, $\Gamma;\Phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash F$ with $|\ol\alpha|
= k$, then $\Gamma;\Phi \vdash H[\phi :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F]$.
Similarly, if \,$\Gamma, \phi^k; \Phi \vdash H$, and if\, $\Gamma;
\ol\psi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash F$ with $|\ol\alpha| = k$ and $\Phi \cap
\ol\psi = \emptyset$, then $\Gamma,\ol\psi';\Phi \vdash H[\phi
  :=_{\ol{\alpha}} F[\ol{\psi :== \psi'}]]$.

\subsection{Terms}\label{sec:terms}
%To define our term calculus we a
Assume an infinite set $\cal V$ of term variables disjoint from
$\tvars$ and $\fvars$. If $\Gamma$ is a type constructor context and
$\Phi$ is a functorial context, then a {\em term context for $\Gamma$
  and $\Phi$} is a finite set of bindings of the form $x : F$, where
$x \in {\cal V}$ and $\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F$. We adopt the above
conventions for disjoint unions and vectors in term contexts.
%as for type constructor and functorial contexts.

%\begin{definition}\label{def:well-formed-terms}
Let $\Delta$ be a term context for $\Gamma$ and $\Phi$.  The formation
rules for the set of\, {\em well-formed terms over $\Delta$} are given
in Figure~\ref{fig:terms}.
%\end{definition}

In the rule for $L_{\ol{\alpha}}x.t$, the $L$ operator binds all
occurrences of the type variables in $\ol{\alpha}$ in the types of $x$
and $t$, as well as all occurrences of $x$ in $t$ themselves. In the
rule for $t_{\ol K} s$ there is one functorial expression in $\ol K$
for every variable in $\ol \alpha$. In the rule for
$\map^{\ol{F},\ol{G}}_H$ there is one functorial expression in $\ol F$
and one functorial expression in $\ol G$ for each variable in
$\ol\phi$. Moreover, for each $\phi^k$ in $\ol\phi$ the number of
variables in $\ol\beta$ in the judgments for functorial expresssions
in $\ol F$ and $\ol G$ is $k$. In the rules for $\tin_H$ and
$\fold^F_H$, the variables in $\ol{\beta}$ are fresh with respect to
$H$, and there is one $\beta$ for every $\alpha$.
%(Recall from above that, in order for the types of $\tin_H$
%and $\fold^F_H$ to be well-formed, the length of $\alpha$ must equal
%the arity of $\phi$.)
Substitution for terms is the obvious extension of the usual
capture-avoiding textual substitution, and weakening is respected.
%Definition~\ref{def:well-formed-terms} ensures that the expected
%weakening rules for well-formed terms hold.

The ``extra'' functorial variables in $\ol{\gamma}$ in the
rules for $\map^{\ol{F},\ol{G}}_H$, $\tin_H$, and $\mathsf{fold}^F_H$ (i.e.,
those variables not affected by the substitution of $\phi$) allow us
to map or fold polymorphic functions over nested types.  Suppose, for
example, that we want to map the polymorphic function
$\mathit{flatten} : \Nat^\gamma
(\mathit{PTree}\,\gamma)\,(\mathit{List}\,\gamma)$ over lists.  The
$\map$ term for this is typeable as follows:

However, this derivation would not possible without the $\ol\gamma$
variables.  Similar remarks explain the appearance of $\ol \gamma$ in
the typing rules for $\tin$ and $\mathtt{fold}$.

Our calculus is expressive enough to define, for example, a function
$\mathit{reversePTree}: \Nat^\alpha \, (\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha)
(\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha)$ that reverses the order of the leaves in a
perfect tree. It maps the perfect tree $((1, 2), (3, 4))$ to $((4, 3),
(2, 1))$.  Unfortunately, we cannot define recursive functions ---
such as a zip function for perfect trees --- that take as inputs a
nested type and an argument of another type, both of which are
parameterized over the same variable. The fundamental issue is that
recursion is expressible only via $\mathtt{fold}$, which produces
natural transformations in some variables $\ol{\alpha}$ from
$\mu$-types to other functors $F$. The restrictions on $\Nat$-types
entail that $F$ cannot itself be a $\Nat$-type containing
$\ol{\alpha}$, so, e.g., $\Nat^\alpha \, (\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha)
(\Nat^\emptyset \, (\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha) (\mathit{PTree}\,(\alpha
\times \alpha)))$ is not well-typed.  Uncurrying gives $\Nat^\alpha \,
(\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha \times \mathit{PTree}\,\alpha)
(\mathit{PTree}\,(\alpha \times \alpha))$, which is well-typed, but
$\mathtt{fold}$ cannot produce a term of this type
%such a natural transformation
because $\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha \times \mathit{PTree}\,\alpha$ is not
a $\mu$-type.


Our calculus can, however, express types of recursive functions that
take multiple nested types as arguments, provided those nested types
are parameterized over disjoint sets of type variables and the return
type of the function is parameterized over only the variables
occurring in the type of its final argument.  Even for ADTs there is a
difference between which folds over them we can type when they are
viewed as ADTs (i.e., as fixpoints of first-order functors) and which
folds we can type when they are viewed as proper nested types (i.e.,
as fixpoints of higher-order functors). This is because, in the return
type of $\mathtt{fold}$, the arguments of the $\mu$-type must be
variables bound by $\Nat$.  For ADTs, the $\mu$-type takes no
arguments, making it possible to write recursive functions, such as a
concatenation function for lists of type $\alpha ; \emptyset \vdash
\Nat^\emptyset \ (\mu \beta. \onet + \alpha \times \beta)\,
(\Nat^\emptyset (\mu \beta. \onet + \alpha \times \beta) \, (\mu
\beta. \onet + \alpha \times \beta))$.  This is not possible for
nested types --- even when they are semantically equivalent to ADTs.

Interestingly, even some recursive functions of a single proper nested
type --- e.g., a reverse function for bushes --- cannot be expressed
as folds because the algebra arguments needed to define them are again
recursive functions with types of the same problematic form as the
type of a zip function for perfect trees.  In order to define such
functions, we could add more expressive recursion combinators.  But
since the expressivity issue for folds over nested types long
pre-dates, and is somewhat orthogonal to, the issue of parametricity
for languages that construct nested types as fixpoints, we do not
consider it further here other than to offer, in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, some ideas for addressing it in future
work.

\begin{comment}
Our rule for forming $\Nat$-types means that 
%Because our calculus is designed to ensure functoriality, and
%functoriality does not interact with polymorphism as well as might be
%hoped,
our calculus cannot express types of recursive functions, such as a
concatenation function for perfect trees, that take as inputs a nested
type and an argument of another type, both of which are parameterized
over the same variable $\alpha$.
%not just one nested type parameterized over a variable $\alpha$ as
%input, but other inputs parameterized over $\alpha$ as well.
For the same reason, our calculus cannot express, e.g., the type of a
zip function for bushes. The fundamental
issue is that recursion is expressible only via folds, and a fold over
a nested type must take a natural transformation as its argument and
return a natural transformation as its result.
%and, unfortunately, the polymorphism natural transformations entail
%leaves no nontrivial way to incorporate data from the second argument
%to a function with a type like that above into a fold over its first
%argument.
In fact, even for ADTs there is a difference between which folds over
them we can type when ADTs are viewed as ADTs --- i.e., as fixpoints
of types interpreted as first-order functors --- and which folds we
can type when ADTs are viewed as proper nested types --- i.e., as
fixpoints of types that are interpreted as higher-order functors ---
because the arity of the recursion variable $\phi$ in the fixpoint in
the return type of $\fold$ must equal the number of variables bound by
its $\Nat$ construct. For ADTs this number can be $0$, making it
possible to write types such as $\alpha; \emptyset \vdash
\Nat^\emptyset \ (\List\,\alpha)\,(\Nat^\emptyset \alpha\,(\List (\mu
\beta. 1 + \beta)))$, all of whose argument types are parameterized
over the same type $\alpha$, which are not possible for nested types
even when they are semantically equivalent to ADTs.
%Currying the type of the function does not help either, since the
%codomain of a fold applied to an algebra must be a functor, and this
%clearly is not the case for a function on nested types that takes
%more than one input involving the same type variable.
%
%For example, we can represent the type of a zip-like function for bushes.
%
%A well-known deeper limitation on folds is that a fold over a nested
%type must take a natural transformation as an argument and return a
%natural transformation; this issue is discussed in more detail in
%Section~\ref{sec:conclusion},
%Unfortunately, the polymorphism natural transformations
%entail leaves no nontrivial way to incorporate data from the second
%argument to a function with a type like that above into a fold over
%its first argument.
Our calculus can, however, express types of recursive functions
that take
%    as arguments
%one proper nested type and as many other (possibly proper)
%as many proper nested types as we wish
multiple nested types as arguments, provided those nested types are
parameterized over disjoint sets of type variables and the return type of
the function is parameterized over only
%any or all of
the variables occurring in the type of its final argument.
Interestingly, even some recursive functions of a single proper
nested type --- e.g., a $\mathtt{reverseBush}$ function that is a true
involution --- cannot be expressed as folds because the algebra
arguments needed to define them are again recursive functions
%  cannot be defined. This happens, for
%  example, when the algebra argument to a fold must be a recursive
%  function
%, and thus must itself be defined as a fold
with types of the same problematic forms.
%More sophisticated combinators for stylized recursion (e.g.,
%generalized folds)
%%  ~\cite{bp99})
%don't mitigate these difficulties, either. Indeed, they appear to be a
%fundamental consequence of the interaction of functoriality and
%polymorphism, not just some peculiarity of our particular calculus.
Allowing extra functorial variables in the codomains of $\Nat$-types
would recover typeability of, say, zip for bushes, but such extended
$\Nat$-types need not have semantics as $\omega$-cocontinuous functors
in $\set$, as will be required in Section~\ref{sec:type-interp}. For
example,
%as shown in Example D, Section VI of~\cite{jp19},
the type $\emptyset; \gamma \vdash \Nat^\emptyset\, (\mu \beta. \onet + \beta)\,
\gamma$ has no such semantics. To remedy this, we would need to
construct our models from semantic categories that are locally
$\lambda$-presentable for $\lambda > \omega$.
%It is tempting to try to recover typeability of, say, a zip function
%for bushes by allowing extra functorial variables in the codomain type
%of $\Nat$-types. But such extended $\Nat$-types need not have
%semantics as $\omega$-cocontinuous functors, as is required in
%Section~\ref{sec:type-interp}. For example, as shown in Example D,
%Section VI of~\cite{jp19}, the type $\emptyset; \gamma \vdash
%\Nat^\emptyset (\onet + \onet)\, \gamma$ does not.
%
Adding more expressive recursion combinators could help, too.
%enhance the expressivity of our calculus
But since the expressivity issue for folds for nested types long
pre-dates, and is somewhat orthogonal to, the issue of parametricity
for languages that construct nested types as fixpoints, we do not
consider it further in this paper other than to identify, in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, some ideas for addressing it in future
work.
%These and other extensions are discussed


The ``extra'' functorial variables in $\ol{\gamma}$ in the rules for
$\map^{\ol{F},\ol{G}}_H$, $\tin_H$, and $\fold^F_H$ allow us to map or
fold polymorphic functions over nested types. Consider, for example,
the polymorphic function $\mathit{flatten} : \Nat^\beta
(\mathit{PTree}\,\beta)\,(\mathit{List}\,\beta)$ that uniformly maps
perfect trees to lists. Even in the absence of extra variables the
instance of $\map$ required to map each non-functorial monomorphic
instantiation of $\mathit{flatten}$ over a list of perfect trees is
well-typed:
\[\begin{array}{l}
\AXC{$\Gamma;\alpha \vdash \mathit{List} \, \alpha$}
\AXC{$\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash \mathit{PTree}\,F$}
\AXC{$\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash \mathit{List}\,G$}
\TIC{$\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\, \emptyset \vdash \map^{\mathit{PTree}\,F,
    \,\mathit{List}\,G}_{\mathit{List}\,\alpha} :
  \Nat^\emptyset (\Nat^\emptyset\,(\mathit{PTree}\, F)\,(\mathit{List}\, G))\,
  (\Nat^\emptyset\,(\mathit{List}\, (\mathit{PTree}\,
  F))\,(\mathit{List}\, (\mathit{List}\, G)))$} \DisplayProof

But in the absence of $\ol \gamma$, the instance
\[\Gamma;\emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash
\map^{\mathit{PTree}\,\beta,\mathit{List}\,\beta}_{\mathit{List}\,\alpha}
: \Nat^\emptyset ( \Nat^\beta(\mathit{PTree}\,

%(\mathit{PTree}\, \beta))\,(\mathit{List}\, (\mathit{List}\,
%\beta))\] of $\mathtt{map}$
required to map the {\em polymorphic} $\mathit{flatten}$ function over
a list of perfect trees is not: in that setting the functorial
contexts for $F$ and $G$ in the rule for $\map^{F,G}_H$ would have to
be empty, but because the polymorphic $\mathit{flatten}$ function is
natural in some variable, say $\delta$, it cannot possibly have a
type of the form $\Nat^\emptyset F\, G$ that would be required for it
to be the function input to $\map$. Since untypeability of this
instance of $\map$ is unsatisfactory in a polymorphic calculus, where
we naturally expect to be able to manipulate entire polymorphic
functions rather than just their monomorphic instances, we use the
``extra'' variables in $\ol \gamma$ to remedy the
situation. Specifically, Figure~\ref{def:terms}
ensures that the instance of $\map$ needed to map the polymorphic
$\mathit{flatten}$ function is typeable as follows:
\[\begin{array}{l}
\AXC{$\Gamma;\alpha,\beta \vdash \mathit{List} \, \alpha$}
\AXC{$\Gamma;\beta \vdash \mathit{PTree}\,\beta \hspace*{0.3in}
  \Gamma;\beta \vdash \mathit{List}\,\beta$}
\BIC{$\Gamma;\emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash
  \map^{F,G}_{\mathit{List}\,\alpha}  : \Nat^\emptyset
  (\Nat^\beta(\mathit{PTree}\, 
  \beta)\,(\mathit{List}\, \beta))\,
 (\Nat^\beta\,(\mathit{List}\,
  (\mathit{PTree}\, \beta))\,(\mathit{List}\, (\mathit{List}\,
  \beta)))$}
\DisplayProof
\end{array}\]
Similar remarks explain the appearance of $\ol \gamma$ in the typing
rules for $\tin$ and $\fold$.

\section{Interpreting Types}\label{sec:type-interp}

\vspace*{-0.1in}

We denote the category of sets and functions by $\set$. The category
$\rel$ has as objects triples $(A,B,R)$, where $R$ is a relation
between sets $A$ and $B$.
%i.e., a subset of $A \times B$,
It has as morphisms from $(A,B,R)$ to $(A',B',R')$ pairs $(f : A \to
A',g : B \to B')$ of morphisms in $\set$ such that $(f a,g\,b) \in R'$
if $(a,b) \in R$. We may write $R : \rel(A,B)$ for $(A,B,R)$.
%when convenient.
If $R : \rel(A,B)$ we write $\pi_1 R$ and $\pi_2 R$ for the {\em
  domain} $A$ of $R$ and the {\em codomain} $B$ of $R$, respectively,
and assume $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are surjective. We write $\Eq_A =
(A,A,\{(x,x)~|~ x \in A\})$ for the {\em equality relation} on the set
$A$.

The key idea underlying Reynolds' parametricity is to give each type
$F(\alpha)$ with one free variable $\alpha$ a {\em set
  interpretation} $F_0$ taking sets to sets and a \emph{relational
  interpretation} $F_1$ taking relations $R : \rel(A,B)$ to relations
$F_1 (R) : \rel(F_0 (A), F_0 (B))$, and to interpret each term
$t(\alpha,x) : F(\alpha)$ with one free term variable $x : G(\alpha)$
as a map $t_0$ associating to each set $A$ a function $t_0(A) : G_0(A)
\to F_0(A)$. These interpretations are given inductively on the
structures of $F$ and $t$ in such a way that they imply two
fundamental theorems. The first is an \emph{Identity Extension Lemma},
which states that $F_1(\Eq_A) = \Eq_{F_0(A)}$, and is the essential
property that makes a model relationally parametric rather than just
induced by a logical relation. The second is an \emph{Abstraction
  Theorem}, which states that, for any $R :\rel(A, B)$,
$(t_0(A),t_0(B))$ is a morphism in $\rel$ from
$(G_0(A),G_0(B),G_1(R))$ to $(F_0(A),F_0(B),F_1(R))$. The Identity
Extension Lemma is similar to the Abstraction Theorem except that it
holds for {\em all} elements of a type's interpretation, not just
those that interpret terms.
%i.e., $t_0(A)$ and $t_0(B)$ map related arguments to
%related results.
Similar theorems are required for types and terms with any number of
free variables.

The key to proving the Identity Extension Lemma
%(Theorem~\ref{thm:iel})
for our calculus is a familiar ``cutting down'' of the interpretations
of universally quantified types to include only the ``parametric''
elements; the relevant types for us are $\Nat$-types.
%(See, e.g.,~\cite{atk12,bfss90,gjfor15,rey83}).
This cutting down requires, as usual, that the set interpretations of
our types are defined simultaneously with their relational
interpretations. We give the set interpretations for our types in
Section~\ref{sec:set-interp} and give their relational interpretations
in Section~\ref{sec:rel-interp}.  While the set interpretations are
relatively straightforward, their relation interpretations are less
so, mainly because of the cocontinuity conditions required to ensure
that they are well-defined. We develop these conditions in
Section~\ref{sec:rel-interp}, which separates
%Definitions~\ref{def:set-sem} and~\ref{def:rel-sem}
our set and relational interpretations in space, but otherwise has no
impact on the fact that they are given by mutual induction.

\subsection{Interpreting Types as Sets}\label{sec:set-interp}

\vspace*{-0.05in}

%A poset $\mcD = (D,\leq)$ is \emph{$\omega$-directed} if every finite
%subset of $D$ has an upper bound. When $\mcD$ is considered as a
%category, we write $d \in \mcD$ to indicate that $d$ is an object of
%$\mcD$ (i.e., $d \in D$). An {\em $\omega$-directed colimit} in a
%category $\mcC$ is a colimit of a diagram $F : {\mathcal D} \to \mcC$,
%where $\mathcal D$ is an $\omega$-directed poset. A category $\mcC$ is
%{\em $\omega$-cocomplete} if it has all $\omega$-directed colimits. A
%cocomplete category is one that has all colimits.
%
%If $\mcA$ and $\mcC$ are $\omega$-cocomplete, then the functor $F :
%\mcA \to \mcC$ is {\em $\omega$-cocontinuous} if it preserves
%$\omega$-directed colimits.  If $\mcA$ is locally small, then an
%object $A$ of $\mcA$ is {\em finitely presentable} if the functor
%$\mathsf{Hom}_\mcA(A, -) : \mcA \to \Set$ preserves $\omega$-directed
%colimits, i.e., if for every $\omega$-directed poset $\mathcal D$ and
%every functor $F : {\mathcal D} \to \mcC$, there is a canonical
%isomorphism $\colim{d \in \mcD}{\mathsf{Hom}_\mcA(A,Fd)} \simeq
%\mathsf{Hom}_{\mcA}(A, \colim{d \in \mcD}{Fd})$. A category $\mcA$ is
%       {\em finitely accessible} if it is $\omega$-cocomplete and has
%       a set $\mcA_0$ of finitely presentable objects such that every
%%       object is an $omega$-directed colimit of objects in $\mcA_0$;
%       it is {\em locally finitely presentable} if it is finitely
%       accessible and cocomplete.
We interpret types in our calculus as $\omega$-cocontinuous functors
on locally finitely presentable categories~\cite{ar94}. Since functor
categories of locally finitely presentable categories are again
locally finitely presentable, this ensures that the fixpoints
interpreting $\mu$-types in $\set$ and $\rel$ exist, and thus that
both the set and relational interpretations of all of the types in
Definition~\ref{def:wftypes} are well-defined~\cite{jp19}. To
bootstrap this process, we will interpret type variables as
$\omega$-cocontinuous functors.
%in Definitions~\ref{def:set-env} and~\ref{def:reln-env}.
If $\cal C$ and $\D$ are locally finitely presentable categories, we
write $[\cal C,\D]$ for the category of $\omega$-cocontinuous functors
from $\cal C$ to $\D$.
%Note that the categories $\set$ and $\rel$ are both locally finitely
%presentable.

%\begin{definition}\label{def:set-env}
A {\em set environment} maps each type variable in $\tvars^k \cup
\fvars^k$ to an element of $[\set^k,\set]$.  A morphism $f : \rho \to
\rho'$ for set environments $\rho$ and $\rho'$ with $\rho|_\tvars =
\rho'|_\tvars$ maps each type constructor variable $\psi^k \in \tvars$
to the identity natural transformation on $\rho \psi^k = \rho'\psi^k$
and each functorial variable $\phi^k \in \fvars$ to a natural
transformation from the $k$-ary functor $\rho \phi^k$ on $\set$ to the
$k$-ary functor $\rho' \phi^k$ on $\set$.  Composition of morphisms on
set environments is componentwise, with the identity morphism mapping
each set environment to itself. This gives a category of set
environments and morphisms between them, denoted $\setenv$.
%\end{definition}
We identify a functor in $[\set^0, \set]$ with its value on $\ast$,
and consider a set environment to map a type variable of arity $0$ to
%an $\omega$-cocontinuous functor from $\set^0$ to $\set$, i.e., to
a set.  If $\ol{\alpha} = \{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k\}$ and $\ol{A} =
\{A_1,...,A_k\}$, then we write $\rho[\ol{\alpha := A}]$ for the set
environment $\rho'$ such that $\rho' \alpha_i = A_i$ for $i = 1,...,k$
and $\rho' \alpha = \rho \alpha$ if $\alpha \not \in
\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k\}$.  If $\rho : \setenv$ we write
$\Eq_\rho$ for the relation environment (see Section~\ref{sec:type-interp})
%Definition~\ref{def:reln-env})
such that $\Eq_\rho v = \Eq_{\rho v}$ for every type variable $v$.
%; see Definition~\ref{def:reln-env} for the complete definition of a
%relation environment.
The {\em set interpretation} $\setsem{\cdot} : \F \to [\setenv, \set]$
is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:set-sem}.
The relational interpretations appearing in the second clause of
%Definition~\ref{def:set-sem}
Figure~\ref{fig:set-sem} are given in Figure~\ref{fig:rel-sem}.

%\begin{definition}\label{def:set-sem}

If $\rho \in \setenv$ and $\vdash F$ then we write $\setsem{\vdash F}$
instead of $\setsem{\vdash F}\rho$ since the environment is
immaterial. The third clause of Figure~\ref{fig:set-sem} does indeed
define a set: local finite presentability of $\set$ and
$\omega$-cocontinuity of $\setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash F}\rho$
ensure that $\{\eta : \setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash F}\rho
\Rightarrow \setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash G}\rho\}$ (which
contains $\setsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^{\ol{\alpha}}\,F\,G}\rho$) is a subset of
$\big\{({\setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash G}\rho[\ol{\alpha :=
      S}]})^{(\setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash F}\rho[\ol{\alpha :=
      S}])}~\big|~ \ol{S} = (S_1,...,S_{|\ol{\alpha}|}), \mbox{ and }$
$S_i \mbox{ is a finite set for } i =
1,...,|\ol{\alpha}|\big\}$. There are countably many tuples
$\ol{S}$, each of which gives a morphism from
${\setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash F}\rho[ \ol{\alpha := S}]}$ to
${\setsem{\Gamma;\ol{\alpha} \vdash G}\rho[\ol{\alpha := S}]}$. But
there are only $\set$-many choices of morphisms between any two
objects since $\set$ is locally small.  We note that $\setsem{\Gamma;
  \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\ol\alpha} F\,G}$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous
because it is a constant functor (and that allowing functorial
variables not in $\ol \alpha$ in $G$ fails here, as shown in
Section~\ref{sec:terms}).
%follows from $\omega$-cocontinuity of $\setsem{\Gamma;\ol\alpha
%\vdash F}$, $\setsem{\Gamma;\ol\alpha \vdash G}$, and the equality
%relation environment $\Eq$.
Interpretations of $\Nat$-types ensure
that $\setsem{\Gamma \vdash F \to G}$ and $\setsem{\Gamma \vdash
  \forall \ol\alpha. F}$ are as expected in any parametric model.

To make sense of the last clause in Figure~\ref{fig:set-sem}, we need
to know that, for each $\rho \in \setenv$, $T^\set_{H,\rho}$ is an
$\omega$-cocontinuous endofunctor on $[\set^k, \set]$, and thus admits
a fixpoint.  Since $T_{H,\rho}^\set$ is defined in terms of
$\setsem{\Gamma;\ol\gamma,\phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H}$, this means
that interpretations of types must be such functors, which in turn
means that the actions of set interpretations of types on objects and
on morphisms in $\setenv$ are intertwined. Fortunately, we know
from~\cite{jp19} that, for every $\Gamma; \ol{\alpha} \vdash G$,
$\setsem{\Gamma; \ol{\alpha} \vdash G}$ is actually in $[\set^k,\set]$
where $k = |\ol \alpha|$. This means that for each $\setsem{\Gamma;
  \ol\gamma, \phi^k, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H}$, the corresponding
operator $T^\set_{H}$ can be extended to a {\em functor} from
$\setenv$ to $[[\set^k,\set],[\set^k,\set]]$. The action of $T^\set_H$
on an object $\rho \in \setenv$ is given by the higher-order functor
$T_{H,\rho}^\set$, whose actions on objects (functors in $[\set^k,
  \set]$) and morphisms (natural transformations between such
functors) are given in Figure~\ref{fig:set-sem}. Its action on a
morphism $f : \rho \to \rho'$ is the higher-order natural
transformation $T^\set_{H,f} : T^\set_{H,\rho} \to T^\set_{H,\rho'}$
whose action on $F : [\set^k,\set]$ is the natural transformation
$T^\set_{H,f}\, F : T^\set_{H,\rho}\,F \to T^\set_{H,\rho'}\,F$ whose
component at $\ol{A}$ is $(T^\set_{H,f}\, F)_{\ol{A}} =
\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\gamma,\phi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash H}f[\phi :=

$T^\set_H$ to define the functorial action of set interpretation.

A {\em $k$-ary relation transformer} $F$ is a triple $(F^1, F^2,F^*)$,
where $F^1,F^2 : [\set^k,\set]$ are functors, $F^* : [\rel^k, \rel]$
is a functor, if $R_1:\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k:\rel(A_k,B_k)$ then $F^*
\ol{R} : \rel(F^1 \ol{A}, F^2 \ol{B})$, and if $(\alpha_1, \beta_1)
\in \Homrel(R_1,S_1),..., (\alpha_k, \beta_k) \in \Homrel(R_k,S_k)$
then $F^* \ol{(\alpha, \beta)} = (F^1 \ol{\alpha}, F^2 \ol{\beta})$.
We define $F\ol{R}$ to be $F^*\overline{R}$ and
$F\overline{(\alpha,\beta)}$ to be $F^*\overline{(\alpha,\beta)}$.
%\end{definition}
The last clause here
%of Definition~\ref{def:rel-transf}
expands to: if
$\ol{(a,b) \in R}$ implies $\ol{(\alpha\,a,\beta\,b) \in S}$ then
$(c,d) \in F^*\ol{R}$ implies $(F^1 \ol{\alpha}\,c,F^2 \ol{\beta}\,d)
\in F^*\ol{S}$. When convenient we identify a $0$-ary relation
transformer $(A,B,R)$ with $R : \rel(A,B)$. We may also write $\pi_1
F$ for $F^1$ and $\pi_2 F$ for $F^2$. We extend these conventions to
relation environments, introduced
%in Definition~\ref{def:reln-env}
below, in the obvious way.

%\begin{definition}
The category $RT_k$ of $k$-ary relation transformers is given by the
following data:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
an object of $RT_k$ is a relation transformer;
%\item
a morphism $\delta : (G^1,G^2,G^*) \to (H^1,H^2,H^*)$ in $RT_k$
  is a pair of natural transformations $(\delta^1, \delta^2)$ where
  $\delta^1 : G^1 \to H^1$, $\delta^2 : G^2 \to H^2$ such that, for
  all $\ol{R : \rel(A, B)}$, if $(x, y) \in G^*\ol{R}$ then
  $(\delta^1_{\ol{A}}x, \delta^2_{\ol{B}}y) \in H^*\ol{R}$; and
  %\item
  identity morphisms and composition are inherited from the
  category of functors on $\set$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{definition}\label{def:RT-functor}
An endofunctor $H$ on $RT_k$ is a triple $H = (H^1,H^2,H^*)$, where
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
$H^1$ and $H^2$ are functors from $[\set^k,\set]$ to $[\set^k,\set]$;
%\item
$H^*$ is a functor from $RT_k$ to $[\rel^k,\rel]$;
%\item
for all $\overline{R : \rel(A,B)}$,
  $\pi_1((H^*(\delta^1,\delta^2))_{\overline{R}}) = (H^1
  \delta^1)_{\overline{A}}$ and
  $\pi_2((H^*(\delta^1,\delta^2))_{\overline{R}}) = (H^2
  \delta^2)_{\overline{B}}$;
%\item
the action of $H$ on objects is given by $H\,(F^1,F^2,F^*) =
  (H^1F^1,\,H^2F^2,\,H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*))$; and 
%\item
the action of $H$ on morphisms is given by
  $H\,(\delta^1,\delta^2) = (H^1\delta^1,H^2\delta^2)$ for
  $(\delta^1,\delta^2) : (F^1,F^2,F^*)\to (G^1,G^2,G^*)$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
Since applying an endofunctor $H$ to $k$-ary relation transformers and
morphisms between them must give $k$-ary relation transformers
and morphisms between them, this definition
%~\ref{def:RT-functor}
implicitly requires the following three conditions to hold: \,{\em i})
%if $R_1:\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k:\rel(A_k,B_k)$ then
$H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*) \ol{R} : \rel(H^1F^1 \ol{A}, H^2F^2 \ol{B})$
whenever $R_1:\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k:\rel(A_k,B_k)$;
  %In other words, $\pi_1 (H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*) \ol{R}) = H^1F^1
  %\ol{A}$ and $\pi_2 (H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*) \ol{R}) = H^2F^2 \ol{B}$.
{\em ii})
%if $(\alpha_1, \beta_1) \in \Homrel(R_1,S_1),..., (\alpha_k,
%  \beta_k) \in \Homrel(R_k,S_k)$ then
  $H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*)\, \ol{(\alpha, \beta)} = (H^1F^1\ol{\alpha}, H^2F^2
  \ol{\beta})$ whenever $(\alpha_1, \beta_1) \in \Homrel(R_1,S_1),..., (\alpha_k,
  \beta_k) \in \Homrel(R_k,S_k)$; and
  %In other words, $\pi_1 (H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*) \ol{(\alpha,
  %  \beta)}) = H^1F^1 \ol{\alpha}$ and $\pi_2 (H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*) 
  % \ol{(\alpha, \beta)}) = H^2F^2 \ol{\beta}$.  {\em iii}) if
  $(\delta^1,\delta^2) : (F^1,F^2,F^*)\to (G^1,G^2,G^*)$ and
  $R_1:\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k:\rel(A_k,B_k)$, then
  $((H^1\delta^1)_{\ol{A}}x, (H^2\delta^2)_{\ol{B}}y) \in
  H^*(G^1,G^2,G^*)\ol{R}$ whenever $(x, y) \in
  H^*(F^1,F^2,F^*)\ol{R}$. Note, however, that this last condition is
  automatically satisfied because it is implied by the third condition
  on functors on relation transformers.
  %point of Definition~\ref{def:RT-functor}.

%\begin{definition}\label{def:RT-nat-trans}
If $H$ and $K$ are endofunctors on $RT_k$, then a {\em natural
  transformation} $\sigma : H \to K$ is a pair $\sigma = (\sigma^1,
\sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^1 : H^1 \to K^1$ and $\sigma^2 : H^2 \to
K^2$ are natural transformations between endofunctors on
$[\set^k,\set]$ and the component of $\sigma$ at $F
%= (F^1,F^2,F^*)
\in RT_k$ is given by $\sigma_F = (\sigma^1_{F^1}, \sigma^2_{F^2})$.
%\end{definition}
This definition
%~\ref{def:RT-nat-trans}
entails that $\sigma^i_{F^i}$ is natural in $F^i : [\set^k,\set]$,
and, for every $F$, both $(\sigma^1_{F^1})_{\overline{A}}$ and
$(\sigma^2_{F^2})_{\overline{A}}$ is natural in $\overline{A}$.
Moreover, since the results of applying $\sigma$ to $k$-ary relation
transformers must be morphisms of $k$-ary relation transformers,
%Definition~\ref{def:RT-nat-trans}
it implicitly requires that $(\sigma_F)_{\overline{R}} = (
(\sigma^1_{F^1})_{\overline{A}}, (\sigma^2_{F^2})_{\overline{B}})$ is
a morphism in $\rel$ for any $k$-tuple of relations $\overline{R :
  \rel(A, B)}$, i.e., that if $(x, y) \in H^*F\overline{R}$, then
$((\sigma^1_{F^1})_{\overline{A}} x, (\sigma^2_{F^2})_{\overline{B}}
y) \in K^*F\overline{R}$.

%  points through text better.}
Critically, we can compute $\omega$-directed colimits in
$RT_k$. Indeed, if $\cal D$ is an $\omega$-directed set then $\colim{d
  \in {\cal D}}{(F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)} = (\colim{d \in {\cal
    D}}{F^1_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^2_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal
    D}}{F^*_d})$.  We define an endofunctor $T = (T^1,T^2,T^*)$ on
$RT_k$ to be {\em $\omega$-cocontinuous} if $T^1$ and $T^2$ are
$\omega$-cocontinuous endofunctors on $[\set^k,\set]$ and $T^*$ is an
$\omega$-cocontinuous functor from $RT_k$ to $[\rel^k,\rel]$, i.e., is
in $[RT_k,[\rel^k,\rel]]$.
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:colimits}
%$\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{(F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)} = (\colim{d \in {\cal
%      D}}{F^1_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^2_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal
%      D}}{F^*_d})$
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%We first observe that $(\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^1_d}, \colim{d \in
%  {\cal D}}{F^2_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^*_d})$ is in $RT_k$.  If
%$R_1:\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k:\rel(A_k,B_k)$, then $\colim{d \in \cal
%  D}{F^*_d\ol{R}} : \rel(\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^1_d\ol{A}},
%\,\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^2_d\ol{B}})$ because of how colimits are
%computed in $\rel$. Moreover, if $(\alpha_1, \beta_1) \in
%\Homrel(R_1,S_1),..., (\alpha_k, \beta_k) \in \Homrel(R_k,S_k)$, then
%\[\begin{array}{ll}
%  & (\colim{d \in \cal D}{F_d^*})\ol{(\alpha,\beta)}\\
%= & \colim{d \in \cal D}{F_d^*\ol{(\alpha,\beta)}}\\
%= & \colim{d \in \cal D}{(F_d^1\ol{\alpha},\, F_d^2\ol{\beta})}\\
%= & (\colim{d \in \cal D}{F^1_d \ol{\alpha}}, \,\colim{d \in \cal D}{
%  F^2_d \ol{\beta}})
%\end{array}\]
%so $(\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^1_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^2_d},
%\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^*_d})$ actually is in $RT_k$.
%
%Now to see that $\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{(F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)} =
%(\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^1_d}, \colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^2_d},
%\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^*_d})$, let $\gamma^1_d : F^1_d \to \colim{d
%  \in {\cal D}}{F^1_d}$ and $\gamma^2_d : F^2_d \to \colim{d \in {\cal
%    D}}{F^2_d}$ be the injections for the colimits $\colim{d \in {\cal
%    D}}{F^1_d}$ and $\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^2_d}$,
%respectively. Then $(\gamma^1_d, \gamma^2_d) : (F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)
%\to \colim{d \in {\cal D}}{(F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)}$ is a morphism in
%$RT_k$ because, for all $\ol{R : \rel(A, B)}$,
%$((\gamma^1_d)_{\ol{A}}, (\gamma^2_d)_{\ol{B}}) : F^*_d \ol{R} \to
%\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^*_d \ol{R}}$ is a morphism in $\rel$. So
%$\{(\gamma^1_d, \gamma^2_d)\}_{d \in {\cal D}}$ are the mediating
%morphisms of a cocone in $RT_k$ with vertex $\colim{d \in {\cal
%    D}}{(F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)}$. To see that this cocone is a
%colimiting cocone, let $C = (C^1,C^2,C^*)$ be the vertex of a cocone
%for $\{(F^1_d,F^2_d,F^*_d)\}_{d \in {\cal D}}$ with injections
%$(\delta^1_d,\delta^2_d) : (F^1_d,F^2_d,F^*_d) \to C$. If $\eta^1 :
%\colim{d \in {\cal D}}{F^1_d} \to C^1$ and $\eta^2 : \colim{d \in
%  {\cal D}}{F^2_d} \to C^2$ are the mediating morphisms in
%$[\set^k,\set]$, then $\eta^1$ and $\eta^2$ are unique such that
%$\delta^1_d = \eta^1 \circ \gamma^1_d$ and $\delta^2_d = \eta^2 \circ
%\gamma^2_d$.  We therefore have that $(\eta^1,\eta^2) : \colim{d \in
%  {\cal D}}{(F^1_d, F^2_d,F^*_d)} \to C$ is the mediating morphism in
%$RT_k$. Indeed, for all $\ol{R : \rel(A,B)}$ and $(x,y) \in \colim{d
%  \in {\cal D}}{F^*_d \ol{R}}$, there exist $d$ and $(x',y') \in
%F^*_d\ol{R}$ such that $(\gamma^1_d)_{\ol{A}}x' = x$ and
%$(\gamma^2_d)_{\ol{B}}y' = y$. But then $(\eta^1_{\ol{A}}x,
%\eta^2_{\ol{B}}y) = (\eta^1_{\ol{A}}((\gamma^1_d)_{\ol{A}}x'),
%\eta^2_{\ol{B}}((\gamma^2_d)_{\ol{B}}y')) = ((\delta^1_d)_{\ol{A}}x',
%(\delta^2_d)_{\ol{B}}y')$, and this pair is in $C^*\ol{R}$ because
%$(\delta^1_d, \delta^2_d)$ is a morphism from $(F^1_d,F^2_d,F^*_d)$ to
%$C$ in $RT_k$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:omega-cocont}
An endofunctor $T = (T^1,T^2,T^*)$ on $RT_k$ is {\em
$\omega$-cocontinuous} if $T^1$ and $T^2$ are $\omega$-cocontinuous
endofunctors on $[\set^k,\set]$ and $T^*$ is an $\omega$-cocontinuous
functor from $RT_k$ to $[\rel^k,\rel]$, i.e., is in
$[RT_k,[\rel^k,\rel]]$.
\end{definition}
\end{comment}
Now, for any $k$, any $A : \set$, and any $R : \rel(A, B)$, let
$K^\set_A$ be the constantly $A$-valued functor from $\set^k$ to
$\set$ and $K^\rel_R$ be the constantly $R$-valued functor from
$\rel^k$ to $\rel$.  Also let $0$ denote either the initial object of
$\set$ or the initial object of $\rel$, as appropriate. Observing
that, for every $k$, $K^\set_0$ is initial in $[\set^k,\set]$, and
$K^\rel_0$ is initial in $[\rel^k,\rel]$, we have that, for each $k$,
$K_0 = (K^\set_0,K^\set_0,K^\rel_0)$ is initial in $RT_k$. Thus, if $T
= (T^1,T^2,T^*) : RT_k \to RT_k$ is an endofunctor on $RT_k$ then we
can define the relation transformer $\mu T$ to be $\colim{n \in
  \nat}{T^n K_0}$.
%Then Lemma~\ref{lem:colimits} shows $\mu T$ is indeed a relation
%transformer, and that it is given explicitly by
It is not hard to see that $\mu T$ is given explicitly as
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:mu}
  %\colim{n \in \nat}{T^n K_0}
$ \mu T = (\mu T^1,\mu T^2,
\colim{n \in \nat}{(T^nK_0)^*})$.
%\end{equation}
As our notation suggests, $\mu T$ really is a fixpoint for $T$ if $T$
is $\omega$-cocontinuous, i.e., 
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:fp} For any
if $T : [RT_k,RT_k]$, then $\mu T \cong T(\mu T)$.
%\end{lemma}
%\noindent
The isomorphism is given by $(\mathit{in}_1, \mathit{in}_2) : T(\mu T)
\to \mu T$ and $(in_1^{-1}, in_2^{-1}) : \mu T \to T(\mu T)$ in
$RT_k$. The latter is always a morphism in $RT_k$, but the former need
not be if $T$ is not $\omega$-cocontinuous.
\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
We have $T(\mu T) = T(\colim{n \in \nat}{(T^nK_0)}) \cong \colim{n \in
\nat}{T(T^nK_0)} =
\mu T$.
\end{proof}
In fact, the isomorphism in Lemma~\ref{lem:fp} is given by the
morphisms $(in_1, in_2) : T(\mu T) \to \mu T$ and $(in_1^{-1},
in_2^{-1}) : \mu T \to T(\mu T)$ in $RT_k$. It is worth noting that the
latter is always a morphism in $RT_k$, but the former isn't necessarily
a morphism in $RT_k$ unless $T$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous.
\end{comment}
Note that the third component of $\mu T$ is the colimit in
$[\rel^k,\rel]$ of third components of relation transformers, rather
than a fixpoint of an endofunctor on $[\rel^k,\rel]$. That there is an
asymmetry between the first two components of $\mu T$ and its third
reflects the important conceptual observation that the third component
of an endofunctor on $RT_k$ need not be a functor on all of
$[\rel^k,\rel]$.
%In particular, although we can define $T_{H,\rho}\,
%F$ for a relation transformer $F$ in Definition~\ref{def:rel-sem}
%below, it is not clear how we could define it for $F : [\rel^k,\rel]$.

%\begin{definition}\label{def:reln-env}
A {\em relation environment} maps each type variable in $\tvars^k \cup
\fvars^k$ to a $k$-ary relation transformer.  A morphism $f : \rho \to
\rho'$ between relation environments $\rho$ and $\rho'$ with
$\rho|_\tvars = \rho'|_\tvars$ maps each type constructor variable
$\psi^k \in \tvars$ to the identity morphism on $\rho \psi^k = \rho'
\psi^k$ and each functorial variable $\phi^k \in \fvars$ to a morphism
from the $k$-ary relation transformer $\rho \phi$ to the $k$-ary
relation transformer $\rho' \phi$. Composition of morphisms on
relation environments is componentwise, with the identity
morphism mapping each relation environment to itself. This gives a
category of relation environments and morphisms between them, 
denoted $\relenv$.
%\end{definition}
When convenient we identify a $0$-ary relation transformer with the
relation (transformer) that is its codomain and consider
% With this convention,
a relation environment to map a type variable of arity $0$
%to a $0$-ary relation transformer, i.e.,
to a relation.  We write $\rho[\ol{\alpha := R}]$ for the relation
environment $\rho'$ such that $\rho' \alpha_i \, = R_i$ for $i =
1,...,k$ and $\rho' \alpha = \rho\alpha$ if $\alpha \not \in
\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k\}$.  If $\rho$ is a relation environment, we
write $\pi_1 \rho$ and $\pi_2 \rho$ for the set environments mapping
each type variable $\phi$ to the functors $(\rho\phi)^1$ and
$(\rho\phi)^2$, respectively.

We define, for each $k$, the notion of an $\omega$-cocontinuous
functor from $\relenv$ to $RT_k$.
%\begin{definition}\label{def:relenv-functor}
A functor $H : [\relenv, RT_k]$ is a triple $H = (H^1,H^2,H^*)$,
where
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
$H^1$ and $H^2$ are objects in $[\setenv,[\set^k,\set]]$;
%\item
$H^*$ is a an object in $[\relenv,[\rel^k,\rel]]$;
%\item
for all $\overline{R : \rel(A,B)}$ and morphisms $f$ in
  $\relenv$, $\pi_1(H^*f \,{\overline{R}}) = H^1 (\pi_1
  f)\,{\overline{A}}$ and $\pi_2(H^*f \,{\overline{R}}) = H^2 (\pi_2
  f)\,{\overline{B}}$;
  %\item
  the action of $H$ on $\rho$ in $\relenv$ is given by $H \rho = (H^1
  (\pi_1 \rho),\,H^2 (\pi_2 \rho),\,H^*\rho)$; and 
  %\item
  The action of $H$ on morphisms $f : \rho \to \rho'$ in $\relenv$
  is given by $Hf = (H^1 (\pi_1 f),H^2 (\pi_2 f))$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
Spelling out the last two points above gives the
following analogues of the three conditions
%immediately following Definition~\ref{def:RT-functor}:
on functors on $\setenv$:
{\em i}) if $R_1 :
\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k : \rel(A_k,B_k)$, then $H^*\rho\, \ol{R} :
\rel(H^1(\pi_1 \rho)\, \ol{A}, H^2(\pi_2 \rho)\, \ol{B})$;
%In other words, $\pi_1 (H^*\rho \ol{R}) = H^1(\pi_1 \rho)
%  \,\ol{A}$ and $\pi_2 (H^*\rho \ol{R}) = H^2 (\pi_2 \rho) \,\ol{B}$;
{\em ii}) if $(\alpha_1, \beta_1) \in \Homrel(R_1,S_1),..., (\alpha_k,
\beta_k) \in \Homrel(R_k,S_k)$, then $H^*\rho\, \ol{(\alpha, \beta)} =
(H^1(\pi_1 \rho)\,\ol{\alpha}, H^2(\pi_2 \rho)\, \ol{\beta})$;
%  In other words, $\pi_1 (H^*\rho\, \ol{(\alpha, \beta)}) = H^1(\pi_1
%  \rho)\,\ol{\alpha}$ and $\pi_2 (H^*\rho\, \ol{(\alpha, \beta)}) =
%  H^2(\pi_2 \rho)\,\ol{\beta}$;
and {\em iii}) if $f : \rho \to \rho'$ and
$R_1:\rel(A_1,B_1),...,R_k:\rel(A_k,B_k)$, then $(H^1(\pi_1
f)\,{\ol{A}}\,x, H^2(\pi_2 f)\,{\ol{B}}\,y) \in H^*\rho'\,\ol{R}$
whenever $(x, y) \in H^*\rho\,\ol{R}$.
%As before, the last
%condition is automatically satisfied because it is implied by the
%third bullet point of Definition~\ref{def:relenv-functor}.

%Considering $\relenv$ as a product $\Pi_{\phi^k \in \tvars \cup
%  \fvars} RT_k$, we extend the
Computation of $\omega$-directed colimits in $RT_k$ extends
componentwise to colimits in $\relenv$. Similarly
$\omega$-cocontinuity for endofunctors on $RT_k$ extends to
%a notion of $\omega$-cocontinuity for
functors from $\relenv$ to $RT_k$.  Recalling from the start of this

Figure~\ref{fig:rel-sem} ensures that $\relsem{\Gamma \vdash F
  \to G}$ and $\relsem{\Gamma \vdash \forall \ol \alpha. F}$ are as
expected in any parametric model.
%$\relsem{\Gamma \vdash
%  \sigma \to \tau}\rho = \relsem{\Gamma \vdash \sigma} \rho \to
%\relsem{\Gamma \vdash \tau} \rho$.
As for set interpretations, $\relsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^{\ol\alpha} F\,G}$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous because it is a constant
functor.
%follows from $\omega$-cocontinuity of
%$\relsem{\Gamma;\ol\alpha \vdash F}$ and
%$\relsem{\Gamma;\ol\alpha \vdash G}$.
If $\rho \in \relenv$
and $\vdash F$, then we write $\relsem{\vdash F}$ instead of
$\relsem{\vdash F}\rho$.  For the last clause in
Figure~\ref{fig:rel-sem} to be well-defined we need $T_{H,\rho}$
to be an $\omega$-cocontinuous endofunctor on $RT$, so that
%, by Lemma~\ref{lem:fp},
it admits a fixpoint. Since $T_{H,\rho}$ is
defined in terms of $\relsem{\Gamma;\ol\gamma,\phi^k, \ol{\alpha}
  \vdash H}$, this means that relational interpretations of types must
be $\omega$-cocontinuous functors from $\relenv$ to $RT_0$, which in
turn entails that the actions of relational interpretations of types
on objects and on morphisms in $\relenv$ are intertwined. As for set
interpretations, we know from~\cite{jp19} that, for every $\Gamma;
\ol{\alpha} \vdash F$, $\relsem{\Gamma; \ol{\alpha} \vdash F}$ is
actually in $[\rel^k,\rel]$ where $k = |\ol \alpha|$.
%In fact, we already know from~\cite{jp19} that, for every $\Gamma;
%\ol{\alpha} \vdash \tau : \F$, $\relsem{\Gamma; \ol{\alpha} \vdash
%  \tau}$ is actually functorial in $\ol{\alpha}$ and
%$\omega$-cocontinuous.
We first define the actions of each of these functors on morphisms
between relation environments, and then argue that
%the functors given by Figure~\ref{fig:rel-sem} and
%Definition~\ref{def:rel-sem-funcs}
they are well-defined and have the required properties. To do this, we
extend $T_H$ to a {\em functor} from $\relenv$ to
$[[\rel^k,\rel],[\rel^k,\rel]]$. Its action on an object $\rho \in
\relenv$ is given by the higher-order functor $T_{H,\rho}$ whose
actions on objects and morphisms are given in
Figure~\ref{fig:rel-sem}. Its action on a morphism $f : \rho
\to \rho'$ is the higher-order natural transformation $T_{H,f} :
T_{H,\rho} \to T_{H,\rho'}$ whose action on any $F : [\rel^k,\rel]$ is
the natural transformation $T_{H,f}\, F : T_{H,\rho}\, F \to
T_{H,\rho'}\, F$ whose component at $\ol{R}$ is $(T_{H,f}\,
F)_{\ol{R}} = \relsem{\Gamma; \ol\gamma,\phi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash
  H}f[\phi := \id_F][\ol{\alpha := \id_R}]$.

Using $T_H$, we can define the functorial action of relational
interpretation.

To see that the functors given by 
%Definition~\ref{def:rel-sem-funcs}
this definition and Figure~\ref{fig:rel-sem} are well-defined we must
show that, for every $H$, $T_{H,\rho}\,F$ is a relation transformer if
$F$ is, and that $T_{H,f}\, F : T_{H,\rho}\, F \to T_{H,\rho'}\, F$ is
a morphism of relation transformers for every relation transformer $F$
and every morphism $f : \rho \to \rho'$ in $\relenv$. This is an
immediate consequence of
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:rel-transf-morph}
%The interpretations in Definitions~\ref{def:rel-sem}
%and~\ref{def:rel-sem-funcs} are well-defined and,
  %For every $\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F$,
\begin{equation}\label{lem:rel-transf-morph}
\sem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F} =
(\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F}, \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
  F},\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F}) \in
%is an $\omega$-cocontinuous functor from $\relenv$ to $RT_0$, i.e., is an
%element of
[\relenv,RT_0]
\end{equation}
%\end{lemma}
\noindent
The proof is a straightforward induction on the structure of $F$,
%%each case of which first shows that $(\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
%  \tau}, \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau},\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
%  \tau})$ is indeed a functor from $\relenv$ to $RT_0$, and then uses
using an appropriate result from~\cite{jp19} to deduce
$\omega$-cocontinuity of $\sem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F}$ in each case.
%together with Lemma~\ref{lem:fp} and Equation~\ref{eq:mu} for
%$\mu$-types.

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
By induction on the structure of $\tau$. The only interesting cases
are when $\tau = \phi\ol{\tau}$ and when $\tau = (\mu \phi^k. \lambda
\overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}$. We consider each in turn.

\begin{itemize}
\item When $\tau = \Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}$, we have    
\[\begin{array}{ll}
  & \pi_i (\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}}\rho)\\
= & \pi_i ((\rho \phi)\overline{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho})\\
= & (\pi_i (\rho \phi)) (\pi_i(\overline{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}))\\
= & ((\pi_i \rho) \phi) (\overline{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
    \tau}(\pi_i \rho)})\\
= & \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}}(\pi_i \rho)
\end{array}\]
and, for $f : \rho \to \rho'$ in $\relenv$,
\[\begin{array}{ll}
  & \pi_i (\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}}f)\\
= & \pi_i ((f\phi)_{\overline{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho'}})
\circ \pi_i((\rho\phi)({\overline{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}f}}))\\
= & (\pi_i (f\phi))_{\overline{\pi_i (\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho')}}
\circ (\pi_i(\rho\phi))({\overline{\pi_i (\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}f}}))\\
= & ((\pi_i f)\phi)_{\overline{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}(\pi_i\rho')}}
\circ ((\pi_i\rho)\phi)({\overline{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}(\pi_i f)}})\\
= & \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}}(\pi_i f)
\end{array}\]
The third equalities of each of the above derivations are by the
induction hypothesis. That $\sem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  \phi\ol{\tau}}$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous is an immediate
consequence of the facts that $\set$ and $\rel$ are locally finitely
presentable, together with Corollary~12 of~\cite{jp19}.
\item When $\tau = (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}$ we first show that $\sem{ (\mu
    \phi. \lambda \overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}}$ is
  well-defined.
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{$T_\rho : [RT_k,RT_k]$}:\/ We must show that, for any
  relation transformer $F = 
  (F^1, F^2, F^*)$, the triple $T_{\rho} F = (T^\set_{\pi_1 \rho}F^1,
  T^\set_{\pi_2 \rho}F^2, T^\rel_{\rho}F)$ is also a relation
  transformer.  Let $\overline{R : \rel(A, B)}$. Then for
  $i = 1, 2$, we have
\[\begin{split}
\pi_i(T^\rel_{\rho}\,F\,\overline{R})
&= \pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H}\rho[\phi := F]\overline{[\alpha := R]}) \\
&= \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H} (\pi_i (\rho[\phi := F]\overline{[\alpha := R]})) \\
&= \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H} (\pi_i \rho)[\phi := \pi_i F]\overline{[\alpha := \pi_i R]}) \\
&= T^\set_{\pi_i \rho} (\pi_i F) (\overline{\pi_i R})
\end{split}\]
and 
\[\begin{split}
\pi_i(T^\rel_{\rho}\,F\,\overline{\gamma})
&= \pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H}\id_\rho[\phi
  := \id_F]\overline{[\alpha := \gamma]}) \\
&= \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H} (\pi_i (\id_\rho[\phi := \id_F]\overline{[\alpha := \gamma]})) \\
&= \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H} \id_{\pi_i \rho}[\phi := \id_{\pi_i F}]\overline{[\alpha := \pi_i \gamma]} \\
&= T^\set_{\pi_i \rho} (\pi_i F) (\overline{\pi_i \gamma})
\end{split}\]
Here, the second equality in each of the above chains of equalities is
by the induction hypothesis.

We also have that, for every morphism $\delta = (\delta^1, \delta^2) :
F \to G$ in $RT_k$ and all $\overline{R : \rel(A, B)}$,
\[\begin{array}{ll}
  & \pi_i((T^\rel_\rho \delta)_{\overline{R}})\\
= & \pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H}\id_\rho[\phi :=
  \delta]\overline{[\alpha := \id_R]})\\
= & \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H}\id_{\pi_i\rho}[\phi :=
  \pi_i \delta]\overline{[\alpha := \id_{\pi_i R}]}\\
= & (T^\set_{\pi_i \rho} (\pi_i \delta))_{\overline{\pi_i R}}
\end{array}\]

Here, the second equality is by the induction hypothesis.  That
$T_\rho$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous follows immediately from the
induction hypothesis on $\sem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash H}$
and the fact that colimts are computed componentwise in $RT$.
\item \underline{$\sigma_f = (\sigma^\set_{\pi_1 f},
  \sigma^\set_{\pi_2 f})$ is a natural transformation from $T_{\rho}$
  to $T_{\rho'}$}:\/ We must show that $(\sigma_f)_F =
  ((\sigma^\set_{\pi_1 f})_{F^1}, (\sigma^\set_{\pi_2 f})_{F^2})$ is a
  morphism in $RT_k$ for all relation transformers $F = (F^1, F^2,
  F^*)$, i.e., that $((\sigma_f)_F)_{\overline{R}}
  =(((\sigma^\set_{\pi_1 f})_{F^1})_{\overline{A}},
  ((\sigma^\set_{\pi_2 f})_{F_2})_{\overline{B}})$ is a morphism in
  $\rel$ for all relations $\overline{R : \rel(A, B)}$. Indeed, we
  have that
\[
((\sigma_f)_F)_{\overline{R}} =
\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi,\overline{\alpha} \vdash H}f[\phi :=
  \id_F]\overline{[\alpha := \id_R]}
\]
is a morphism in $RT_0$ (and thus in $\rel$) by the induction hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{0.05in}

The relation transformer $\mu T_\rho$ is therefore a fixpoint of
$T_\rho$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:fp}, and $\mu \sigma_f$ is a morphism in
$RT_k$ from $\mu T_\rho$ to $\mu T_{\rho'}$. ($\mu$ is shown to be a
functor in~\cite{jp19}.)  So $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu
  \phi. \lambda \overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}}$, and thus
$\sem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}}$, is well-defined.

\vspace*{0.1in}

To see that $\sem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}} : [\relenv,RT_0]$, we must
verify three conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Condition (1) after Definition~\ref{def:relenv-functor} is
  satisfied since
\[\begin{split}
\pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\alpha}. H) \overline{\tau}}\rho) 
&= \pi_i( (\mu T_\rho) (\overline{\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
    \tau}\rho})) \\ 
&= \pi_i(\mu T_{\rho}) (\overline{\pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
    \tau}\rho})) \\ 
&= \mu T^\set_{\pi_i\rho} (\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
    \tau}(\pi_i\rho)}) \\ 
&= \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda \overline\alpha. H)
  \overline{\tau}}(\pi_i\rho) 
\end{split}\]
The third equality is by Equation ~\ref{eq:mu} and the induction
hypothesis.
\item Condition (2) after Definition~\ref{def:relenv-functor} is
  satisfied since it is subsumed by the previous condition because $k
  = 0$.
\item The third bullet point of Definition~\ref{def:relenv-functor} is
  satisfied because
\[\begin{split}
& \pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline\alpha. H)\overline{\tau}}f)\\
&= \pi_i((\mu T_{\rho'})(\overline{\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
    \tau}f}) \circ (\mu \sigma_f)_{\overline{\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi
      \vdash \tau}\rho}}) \\ 
&= \pi_i((\mu T_{\rho'})(\overline{\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
    \tau}f})) \circ \pi_i((\mu
\sigma_f)_{\overline{\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}}) \\  
&= \pi_i(\mu T_{\rho'})(\overline{\pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi
    \vdash \tau}f})) \circ \pi_i(\mu
\sigma_f)_{\overline{\pi_i(\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash 
      \tau}\rho})} \\ 
&= (\mu T^\set_{\pi_i \rho'})(\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
    \tau}(\pi_i f)}) \circ (\mu \sigma^\set_{\pi_i
  f})_{\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau}(\pi_i\rho)}} \\ 
&= \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline\alpha. H)\overline{\tau}}(\pi_i f). 
\end{split}\]
The fourth equality is by~\ref{eq:mu} and the induction hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
As before, that $\sem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\alpha}. H)\overline{\tau}}$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous
follows from the facts that $\set$ and $\rel$ are locally finitely
presentable, and that colimits in $\relenv$ are computed
componentwise, together with Corollary~12 of~\cite{jp19}.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
---
The next two theorems are proven by simultaneous induction. We are
actually only interested in using Theorem~\ref{thm:demotion-objects},
but in order to prove the $\mu$ case for this theorem, we need
Theorem~\ref{thm:demotion-morph} to show that two functors have equal
actions on morphisms.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:demotion-objects}
Let $\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau : \F$. If $\rho, \rho' : \setenv$
are such that $\rho \phi = \rho \psi = \rho' \phi = \rho' \psi$, and
if $f : \rho \to \rho'$ is a morphism of set environments such that $f
\phi = f \psi = \id_{\rho \phi}$, then
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} \rho = \setsem{\Gamma, \psi;
  \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi] } \rho\]
and
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f = \setsem{\Gamma, \psi;

\vspace*{0.1in}

\noindent
Analogously, if $\rho, \rho' : \relenv$ are such that $\rho \phi =
\rho \psi = \rho' \phi = \rho' \psi$, and if $f : \rho \to \rho'$ is a
morphism of relation environments such that $f \phi = f \psi =
\id_{\rho \phi}$, then
\[\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} \rho = \relsem{\Gamma, \psi;
  \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi] } \rho\]
and
\[\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f = \relsem{\Gamma, \psi;
  \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]} f\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We prove the result for set interpretations by induction on the
structure of $\tau$.  The case for relational interpretations proceeds
analogously. Since the only interesting cases are the application case
and the $\mu$-case, we elide the others.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \phi \ol\tau : \F$, then the
  induction hypothesis gives that  
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau } \rho = \setsem{\Gamma,
  \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi] } \rho\] 
and
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f = \setsem{\Gamma, \psi;
  \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]} f\]
for each $\tau$. Then
\begin{align*}
 & \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \phi \ol\tau } \rho \\
= \; & (\rho \phi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau } \rho} \\
= \; & (\rho \phi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :==
      \psi] } \rho} \\ 
= \; & (\rho \psi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :==
      \psi] } \rho} \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \psi \ol{\tau[\phi :== \psi]}
} \rho \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash (\phi \ol\tau)[\phi :== \psi]
} \rho 
\end{align*}
Here, the first and fifth equalities are by
Definition~\ref{def:set-sem}, and the fourth equality is by equality
of the functors $\rho \phi$ and $\rho \psi$. We also have that
\begin{align*}
& \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \phi \ol\tau} f \\
= \; & (f \phi)_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} \rho'}} 
    \circ (\rho \phi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f} \\
= \; & (\id_{\rho \phi})_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} \rho'}} 
    \circ (\rho \phi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f} \\
= \; & (\rho \phi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f} \\
= \; & (\rho \psi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :==
      \psi]} f} \\ 
= \; & (\id_{\rho \psi})_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash
      \tau[\phi :== \psi]} \rho'}} \circ (\rho \psi)
\ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]} f} \\ 
= \; & (f \psi)_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :==
        \psi]} \rho'}} \circ (\rho \psi) \ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi;
    \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]} f} \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \psi \ol{\tau[\phi :== \psi]}} f \\
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash (\phi \ol\tau) [\phi :== \psi]} f
\end{align*}
\item If $\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash (\mu \phi'. \lambda
  \ol\alpha. H)\ol\tau : \F$, then the induction hypothesis gives that
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H } \rho =
\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]
} \rho\]
and 
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau } \rho = \setsem{\Gamma,
  \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi] } \rho\]
as well as that
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H } f =
\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]
} f\]
and 
\[\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau } f = \setsem{\Gamma, \psi;
  \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi] } f\]
for each $\tau$. Then
\begin{align*}
& \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash (\mu \phi'. \lambda
    \ol\alpha. H)\ol\tau } \rho \\ 
= \; & (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi',
  \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha := A}]))
\ol{\setsem{ \Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} \rho} \\ 
= \; & (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} \rho[\phi' :=
  F][\ol{\alpha := A}])) \ol{\setsem{ \Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau}
  \rho} \\ 
= \; &  (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} \rho[\phi' :=
  F][\ol{\alpha := A}])\ol{\setsem{ \Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash
    \tau[\phi :== \psi]} \rho} \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi'. \lambda
  \ol\alpha. H[\phi :== \psi]) \ol{\tau[\phi :== \psi]} } \rho \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash ((\mu \phi'. \lambda
  \ol\alpha. H) \ol\tau)[\phi :== \psi] } \rho   
\end{align*} 
The first and fifth equalities are by Definition~\ref{def:set-sem}.
The second equality follows from the following equality:
\begin{align*}
&\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha},
    \phi \vdash H} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha := A}] \\ 
& = \lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi, \phi',
    \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha
      := A}] 
\end{align*}
These two maps have the same actions on objects and morphisms by the
induction hypothesis on $H$, and the fact that the extended
environment $\rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha := A}]$ satisfies the
required hypothesis. They are thus equal as functors and so have the
same fixpoint. We also have that 
\begin{align*}
& \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash (\mu \phi'. \lambda
    \ol\alpha. H)\ol\tau } f \\ 
= \; & (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi',
  \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H} f [\phi' := \id_F][\ol{\alpha :=
    \id_A}]))_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} \rho'}} \\ 
\; & \circ (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha :=
    A}])) \ol{\setsem{ \Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \tau} f} \\ 
= \; & (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi',
  \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H} f [\phi' := \id_F][\ol{\alpha :=
    \id_A}]))_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :==
        \psi]} \rho'}} \\ 
\; & \circ (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha :=
    A}])) \ol{\setsem{ \Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]}
  f} \\ 
= \; & (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} f [\phi' :=
  \id_F][\ol{\alpha := \id_A}]))_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi
      \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]} \rho'}} \\ 
\; & \circ (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha}, \phi \vdash H} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha :=
    A}])) \ol{\setsem{ \Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]}
  f} \\ 
= \; & (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi,
  \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} f [\phi' :=
  \id_F][\ol{\alpha := \id_A}]))_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi
      \vdash \tau[\phi :== \psi]} \rho'}} \\ 
\; & \circ (\mu (\lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi;
  \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} \rho[\phi' :=
  F][\ol{\alpha := A}])) \ol{\setsem{ \Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash
    \tau[\phi :== \psi]} f} \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi'. \lambda
  \ol\alpha. H[\phi :== \psi]) \ol{\tau[\phi :== \psi]} } f \\ 
= \; & \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi \vdash ((\mu \phi'. \lambda
  \ol\alpha. H) \ol\tau)[\phi :== \psi] } f 
\end{align*} 
The first and fifth equalities are by Definition~\ref{def:set-sem}.
The third equality is by the equality of the arguments to the first
$\mu$ operator:
\begin{align*}
& \lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha},
    \phi \vdash H} f [\phi' := \id_F][\ol{\alpha := \id_A}] \\ 
& = \lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi, \phi',
    \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} f [\phi' := \id_F][\ol{\alpha
      := \id_A}] 
\end{align*}
By the induction hypothesis on $H$ and the fact that the morphism
$f[\phi' := \id_F][\ol{\alpha := \id_A}] : \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha
    := A}] \to \rho'[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha := A}]$ still satisfies
the required hypotheses.  The fourth equality is by the equality of
the arguments to the second $\mu$ operator:
\begin{align*}
& \lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi', \ol{\alpha},
    \phi \vdash H} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha := A}] \\ 
& = \lambda F. \lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma, \psi; \Phi, \phi',
    \ol{\alpha} \vdash H[\phi :== \psi]} \rho[\phi' := F][\ol{\alpha
      := A}] 
\end{align*}
By the same reasoning as above, these two maps are equal as functors,
and thus have the same fixpoint.
\end{itemize}

The following lemma ensures that substitution interacts well with type
interpretations.  It is a consequence of
Definitions~\ref{def:second-order-subst},~\ref{def:set-interp},
and~\ref{def:rel-interp}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:substitution}
Let $\rho$ and $\rho'$ be set environments and let $f : \rho \to \rho'$ be a
morphism of set environments. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\Gamma;\Phi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash F$ and $\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau$,
  then  
\begin{gather}\label{eq:subs-var}
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}\rho =
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash F}\rho[\ol{\alpha :=
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}]\\
\intertext{and}\label{eq:subs-var-morph}
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}f =
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\ol{\alpha} \vdash F}f[\ol{\alpha :=
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau}f}]
\end{gather}
\item If $\Gamma;\Phi,\phi^k\vdash F$ and
  $\Gamma;\Phi,\alpha_1...\alpha_k \vdash H$, then 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:subs-const}
\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F[\phi := H]}\rho
= \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash F}\rho
[\phi := \lambda \ol{A}.\, \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash
    H}\rho[\overline{\alpha := A}]] \\ 
\intertext{and}\label{eq:subs-const-morph}
\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F[\phi := H]}f
= \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash F}f
[\phi := \lambda \ol{A}.\,\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash
    H}f[\overline{\alpha := \id_{\ol{A}}}]] 
\end{gather}
\end{itemize}
Analogous identities hold for relation environments and morphisms
between them.
\end{lemma}
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
The proofs for the set and relational interpretations are completely
analogous, so we just prove the former. Likewise, we only prove
Equations~\ref{eq:subs-var} and~\ref{eq:subs-const}, since the proofs
for Equations~\ref{eq:subs-var-morph} and~\ref{eq:subs-const-morph}
are again analogous. Finally, we prove Equation~\ref{eq:subs-var} for
substitution for just a single type variable since the proof for
multiple simultaneous substitutions proceeds similarly.

Although Equation~\ref{eq:subs-var} is a special case of
Equation~\ref{eq:subs-const}, it is convenient to prove
Equation~\ref{eq:subs-var} first, and then use it to prove
Equation~\ref{eq:subs-const}. We prove Equation~\ref{eq:subs-var} by
induction on the structure of $F$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash F : \T$, or if $F$ is $\onet$ or
  $\zerot$, then $F$ does not contain any functorial variables to
  replace, so there is nothing to prove.
\item If $F$ is $F_1 \times F_2$ or $F_1 + F_2$, then the substitution
  distributes over the product or coproduct as appropriate, so the
  result follows immediately from the induction hypothesis.
\item If $F = \beta$ with $\beta \neq \alpha$, then there is nothing to
  prove.
\item If $F = \alpha$, then
\[\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\alpha[\alpha := \tau]}\rho \, = \,
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\tau}\rho \, = \,
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\alpha\vdash\alpha}\rho[\alpha :=
  \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\tau}\rho]\]
\item If $F = \phi \overline{\sigma}$ with $\phi \neq \alpha$, then
\[\begin{array}{ll}
 &\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\phi \overline{\sigma})[\alpha := \tau]}\rho\\
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi (\overline{\sigma[\alpha := \tau]})}\rho \\
=&(\rho\phi)\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\sigma[\alpha := \tau]}\rho} \\
=&(\rho\phi)\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\alpha\vdash\sigma}
      \rho [\alpha := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\tau}] } \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \alpha \vdash \phi \overline{\sigma}}
      \rho [\alpha := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\tau}]
\end{array}\]
Here, the third equality is by the induction hypothesis.
\item If $F = (\mu \phi. \lambda \overline{\beta}. G)
  \overline{\sigma}$, then
\[\begin{array}{ll}
  & \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash ((\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\beta}. G) \overline{\sigma}) [\alpha := \tau]}\rho \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi. \lambda
  \overline{\beta}. G[\alpha := \tau]) (\overline{\sigma [\alpha :=
      \tau]})}\rho \\ 
=&\mu(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \overline{\beta} \vdash G[\alpha := \tau]}
      \rho[\phi := \text{--}][\overline{\beta := \text{--}}])
      (\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \sigma [\alpha := \tau]}\rho}) \\
=&\mu(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \overline{\beta}, \alpha \vdash G}
\rho [\alpha := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau}\rho] [\phi := \text{--}]
[\overline{\beta := \text{--}}]) \\
 &\hspace{0.5in} (\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\alpha \vdash \sigma}
   \rho [\alpha := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash \tau}\rho]}) \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\alpha\vdash(\mu\phi.\lambda\overline{\beta}.G)
  \overline{\sigma}}\rho  [\alpha := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
   \tau}\rho] 
\end{array}  \]
Here, the third equality is by the induction hypothesis and weakening.
\end{itemize}

We now prove Equation~\ref{eq:subs-const}, again by induction on the
structure of $F$.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash F : \T$, or if $F$ is $\onet$ or
  $\zerot$, then $F$ does not contain any functorial variables to
  replace, so there is nothing to prove.
\item If $F$ is $F_1 \times F_2$ or $F_1 + F_2$, then the substitution
  distributes over the product or coproduct as appropriate, so the
  result follows immediately from the induction hypothesis.
\item If $F = \phi \overline{\tau}$, then
\[\begin{array}{ll}
 &\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\phi \overline{\tau})[\phi := H]}\rho \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash H[\overline{\alpha:= \tau[\phi := H]}]}\rho \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash H}\rho [\overline{\alpha:=
    \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi\vdash\tau[\phi := H]}\rho}] \\ 
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash H}\rho [\overline{\alpha:=
    \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi\vdash\tau} \rho [\phi :=
      \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash
        H}\rho[\overline{\alpha := \text{--}}]]}] \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi \vdash \phi \overline{\tau}}\rho [\phi :=
  \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash H}\rho[\overline{\alpha
      := \text{--}}]] 
  \end{array}\]
Here, the first equality is by
Definition~\ref{def:second-order-subst}, the second is by
Equation~\ref{eq:subs-var}, the third is by the induction hypothesis,
and the fourth is by Definition~\ref{def:set-sem}.
\item If $F = \psi \overline{\tau}$ with $\psi \neq \phi$, then the
  proof is similar to that for the previous case, but simpler, because
  $\phi$ only needs to be substituted in the arguments $\ol{\tau}$ of
  $\psi$.
\item If $F = (\mu \psi. \lambda \overline{\beta}. G)
  \overline{\tau}$, then
\[\begin{array}{ll}
 &\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash ((\mu \psi. \lambda \overline{\beta}. G)
 \overline{\tau})[\phi := H]}\rho \\ 
=&\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \psi. \lambda
  \overline{\beta}. G[\phi := H]) (\overline{\tau[\phi := H]})}\rho \\
=&\mu(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \psi, \overline{\beta} \vdash G[\phi := H]}
    \rho[\psi := \text{--}][\overline{\beta := \text{--}}])
    (\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \tau[\phi := H]}\rho}) \\
=&\mu(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \psi, \overline{\beta}, \phi \vdash G}
\rho [\phi := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash
    H}\rho[\overline{\alpha := \text{--}}]][\psi := \text{--}]
     [\overline{\beta := \text{--}}]) \\
&\hspace{0.5in} (\overline{\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi \vdash \tau} \rho
       [\phi := \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash H}
         \rho[\overline{\alpha := \text{--}}]]}) \\
=&\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\phi\vdash(\mu\psi.\lambda\overline{\beta}.G)
  \overline{\tau}}\rho [\phi :=
  \setsem{\Gamma;\Phi,\overline{\alpha}\vdash H}\rho[\overline{\alpha
      := \text{--}}]] 
\end{array}\]
Here, the first equality is by
Definition~\ref{def:second-order-subst}, the second and fourth are by
Definition~\ref{def:set-sem}, and the third is by the induction
hypothesis and weakening.

\section{The Identity Extension Lemma}\label{sec:iel}

\vspace*{-0.1in}

In most treatments of parametricity, equality relations on sets are
taken as {\em given} --- either directly as diagonal relations or
perhaps via reflexive graphs --- and the graph relations used to
validate existence of initial algebras are defined in terms of
them. Below, by contrast, we give a categorical definition of graph
relations for natural transformations and {\em construct} equality
relations as particular graph relations. Our definitions specialize to
the usual ones for the graph relation for a morphism between sets and
the equality relation for a set.
%In light of its novelty, we spell out our construction in detail.

The standard definition of the graph for a morphism $f : A \to B$ in
$\set$ is the relation $\graph{f} : \rel(A,B)$ defined by $(x,y) \in
\graph{f}$ iff $fx = y$. This definition naturally generalizes to
associate to each natural transformation between $k$-ary functors on
$\set$ a $k$-ary relation transformer. Indeed,
%\begin{definition}\label{def:graph-nat-transf}
if $F, G: \Set^k \to \Set$
%are $k$-ary functors
and $\alpha : F \to G$ is a natural transformation, then the functor
$\graph{\alpha}^*: \rel^k \to \rel$ is defined as follows. Given $R_1
: \rel(A_1, B_1),...,R_k : \rel(A_k,B_k)$, let $\iota_{R_i} : R_i
\hookrightarrow A_i \times B_i$, for $i = 1,...,k$, be the inclusion
of $R_i$ as a subset of $A_i \times B_i$,
%. By the universal property of the product, there exists a
let $h_{\overline{A \times B}}$ be the unique morphism making the left
diagram below commute, and let $h_{\overline{R}} : F\overline{R} \to
F\overline{A} \times G\overline{B}$ be $h_{\overline{A \times B}}
\circ F\overline{\iota_R}$.  Further, let $\alpha^\wedge\overline{R}$
be the subobject through which $h_{\overline{R}}$ is factorized by the
mono-epi factorization system in $\set$, as in the right diagram
below. Then $\alpha^\wedge\overline{R} : \rel(F\overline{A},
G\overline{B})$ by construction, so the action of $\langle \alpha
\rangle^*$ on objects can be given by $\langle \alpha \rangle^*
\overline{(A,B,R)} = (F\overline{A}, G\overline{B},
\iota_{\alpha^\wedge \overline{R}}\alpha^\wedge\overline{R})$. Its
action on morphisms is given by $\graph{\alpha}^*\overline{(\beta,
  \beta')} = (F\overline\beta, G\overline\beta')$.

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
Clearly, $\graph{\alpha}^*$ is $\omega$-cocontinuous, so
$\graph{\alpha}^* : [\rel^k,\rel]$. Now, let $\overline{R :
  \rel(A, B)}$, $\overline{S : \rel(C, D)}$, and $\overline{(\beta,
  \beta') : R \to S}$. We want to show that there exists a morphism
$\epsilon : \alpha^\wedge\overline{R} \to \alpha^\wedge\overline{S}$
such that the diagram on the left below commutes. Since
$\ol{(\beta,\beta') : R \to S}$, there exist $\overline{\gamma : R \to
  S}$ such that each diagram in the middle commutes.
Moreover, since both $h_{\overline{C \times D}} \circ
F(\overline{\beta \times \beta'})$ and $(F\overline{\beta} \times
G\overline{\beta'}) \circ h_{\overline{A \times B}}$ make the diagram
on the right commute, they must be equal.

      \vspace*{-0.1in}
\end{proof}


If $f : A \to B$ is a function with graph relation $\graph{f} = (A, B,
\graph{f}^*)$, then $\langle \id_{A}, f \rangle : A \to A \times B$
and $\langle \id_{A}, f \rangle\, A = \graph{f}^*$.  Moreover, if
$\iota_{\graph{f}} : \graph{f}^* \hookrightarrow A \times B$ is the
inclusion of $\graph{f}^*$ into $A \times B$ then there is an
isomorphism of subobjects
\[\begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[rr, "{\cong}"] \ar[dr, "{\langle \id_{A}, f \rangle}"']
&&{\graph{f}^*} \ar[dl, "{\iota_{\graph{f}}}"]\\
&A \times B
\end{tikzcd}\]

We also note that if $f : A \to B$ is a function seen as a natural
transformation between 0-ary functors, then $\graph{f}$ is (the 0-ary
relation transformer associated with) the graph relation of $f$.
Indeed, we need to apply Definition~\ref{definition:graph-nat-transf} with $k
= 0$, i.e., to the degenerate relation $\ast : \rel(\ast, \ast)$.  As
degenerate $0$-ary functors, $A$ and $B$ are constant functors, i.e.,
$A\, \ast = A$ and $B\, \ast = B$.  By the universal property of the
product, there exists a unique $h$ making the diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = large]
        A
        &A
        \ar[l, equal]
        \ar[r, equal]
        \ar[d, dashed, "{h}"]
        &A
        \ar[r, "{f}"]
        &B \\
        &A \times B
        \ar[ul, "{\pi_1}"] \ar[urr, "{\pi_2}"']
\end{tikzcd}\]
commute. Since $\iota_\ast : \ast \to \ast$ is the identity on $\ast$,
and $A\, \id_{\ast} = \id_{A}$, we have $h_{\ast} = h$.  Moreover,
$h_{\overline{A \times B}} = \langle \id_{A}, f \rangle$ is a
monomorphism in $\set$ because $\id_{A}$ is.  Then,
$\iota_{f^\wedge\ast} = \langle \id_{A}, f \rangle$ and $f^\wedge\ast
= A$, from which we deduce that $\iota_{f^\wedge\ast} f^\wedge\ast =
\langle \id_{A}, f \rangle\, A = \graph{f}^*$. This ensures that the
graph of $f$ as a 0-ary natural transformation coincides with the
graph of $f$ as a morphism in $\set$, and so that
Definition~\ref{dfn:graph-nat-transf} is a reasonable generalization
of Definition~\ref{def:graph}.

Just as the equality relation $\Eq_B$ on a set $B$ coincides with
$\graph{\id_B}$, the graph of the identity on the set, so we can
define the equality relation transformer to be the graph of the
identity natural transformation. This gives

\begin{definition}
Let $F : [\set^k, \set]$.  The equality relation transformer on $F$ is
defined to be $\Eq_F = \graph{\id_{F}}$. This entails that $Eq_F = (F,
F, \Eq_F^*)$ with $\Eq_F^* = \graph{\id_{F}}^*$.
\end{definition}
\end{comment}

\noindent
The graph relation transformer $\langle f \rangle$, for $f : A \to B$
in $\set$ considered as a natural transformation between $0$-ary
functors $A$ and $B$, coincides with the usual definition of
$\graph{f}$, so graph relation transformers do extend graph relations
to functors.  The next lemma computes the action of a graph relation
transformer on graph relations.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:eq-reln-equalities}
If $\alpha : F \to G$ is a morphism in $[\Set^k, \Set]$
and $f_1: A_1 \to B_1, ..., f_k : A_k \to B_k$,
then $\graph{\alpha}^* \graph{\overline{f}}
= \langle G \ol{f} \circ \alpha_{\ol{A}} \rangle
= \langle \alpha_{\ol{B}} \circ F \ol{f} \rangle$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
Since $h_{\overline{A \times B}}$ is the unique morphism making the
bottom triangle of the diagram on the left below commute, and since
$h_{\graph{\overline{f}}} = h_{\overline{A \times B}} \circ F
\,\ol{\iota_{\graph{f}}} = h_{\overline{A \times B}} \circ F
\overline{\langle \id_A, f \rangle}$, the universal property of the
product depicted in the diagram on the right gives
$h_{\graph{\overline{f}}} = \langle \id_{F \ol{A}}, \alpha_{\ol{B}}
\circ F\ol{f} \rangle : F \ol{A} \to F \ol{A} \times G \ol{B}$.

Moreover, $\langle \id_{F \ol{A}}, \alpha_{\ol{B}} \circ
F\ol{f} \rangle$ is a monomorphism in $\set$ because $\id_{F \ol{A}}$
is, so its epi-mono factorization gives $\iota_{\alpha^\wedge
  \graph{\overline{f}}} = \langle \id_{F \ol{A}}, \alpha_{\ol{B}}
\circ F\ol{f} \rangle$, and thus $\alpha^\wedge \graph{\overline{f}} =
%the domain of $\iota_{\alpha^\wedge \graph{\overline{f}}}$, is equal
%to
F\overline{A}$.  Then $\iota_{\alpha^\wedge
  \graph{\overline{f}}} \alpha^\wedge \graph{\overline{f}} = \langle
\id_{F \ol{A}}, \alpha_{\ol{B}} \circ F\ol{f} \rangle (F \ol{A}) =
\graph{ \alpha_{\ol{B}} \circ F\ol{f} }^*$,
%(where the last equality is by Remark~\ref{rmk:graph-fn}).
%We therefore conclude that
so that $\graph{ \alpha }^* \graph{ \overline{f} } = (F\overline{A},
G\overline{B}, \iota_{\alpha^\wedge \graph{\overline{f}}}\,
\alpha^\wedge \graph{\overline{f}}) = (F\overline{A}, G\overline{B},
\graph{ \alpha_{\ol{B}} \circ F\ol{f} }^*) = \graph{ \alpha_{\ol{B}}
  \circ F\ol{f} }$.  Finally, $\alpha_{\ol{B}} \circ F\ol{f} = G\ol{f}
\circ \alpha_{\ol{A}}$ by naturality of $\alpha$.

To prove the IEL we will need to know that equality relation
transformers preserve equality relations. The {\em equality relation
  transformer} on $F : [\set^k,\set]$ is $\Eq_F = \graph{\id_{F}} =
(F, F, \graph{\id_{F}}^*)$. Lemma~\ref{lem:eq-reln-equalities} then
gives that, for all $\ol{A : \set}$,
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:eq-pres-eq}
\Eq^*_F \ol{\Eq_A}
= \graph{\id_F}^* \graph{\id_{\ol{A}}}
= \graph{F \id_{\ol{A}} \circ (\id_F)_{\ol{A}}}
= \graph{\id_{F\ol{A}} \circ \id_{F\ol{A}}}
= \graph{\id_{F\ol{A}}}
= \Eq_{F\ol{A}}
\end{equation*}
%$\Eq^*_F \,\ol{\Eq_A} = \Eq_{F\ol{A}}$
Graph relation transformers extend to relation environments in the
obvious way. If $\rho, \rho' : \setenv$ and $f : \rho \to \rho'$, then
the {\em graph relation environment} $\graph{f}$ is defined pointwise
by $\graph{f} \phi = \graph{f \phi}$ for every $\phi$. This entails
that $\pi_1 \graph{f} = \rho$ and $\pi_2 \graph{f} = \rho'$.  The {\em
  equality relation environment} $\Eq_\rho$ is defined to be
$\graph{\id_{\rho}}$.
%It is such that $\Eq_\rho \phi = \Eq_{\rho \phi}$ for every $\phi$.
%
%  With these definitions in hand, we can state and prove both an
%  Identity Extension Lemma and a Graph Lemma for our calculus.
\begin{theorem}[IEL]\label{thm:iel}
    If $\rho : \setenv$, then
  %and $\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F$ then
  $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} \Eq_\rho = \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma;
      \Phi \vdash F}\rho}$.
\end{theorem}
The IEL's highly non-trivial proof is by induction on the
structure of $F$. Only the $\Nat$, application, and fixpoint cases are
non-routine. The latter two use
Lemma~\ref{lem:eq-reln-equalities}. The fixpoint case also uses that,
for every $n \in \nat$, the following intermediate results can be
proved by simultaneous induction with Theorem~\ref{thm:iel}: for any
$H$, $\rho$, $A$, and subformula $J$ of $H$, both
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate1}
$T^n_{H,\Eq_{\rho}} K_0\, \ol{\Eq_A}

hold. With these results in hand, the proof is not hard.  {\color{red}
  It is given in detail in the appendix.} The proof reveals that if
functorial variables of arity greater than $0$ could appear in the
bodies of $\mu$-types, the IEL would fail.

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
By induction on the structure of $\tau$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\relsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash v}\Eq_{\rho} = \Eq_{\rho} v =
  \Eq_{\rho v} = \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash v}\rho}$ where
  $v \in \Gamma$.
\item By definition, $\relsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^{\overline\alpha} \,F\,G} \Eq_{\rho}$ is the relation on
  $\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\overline\alpha} \,F\,G}
  \rho$ relating $t$ and $t'$ if, for all ${R_1 :
    \rel(A_1,B_1)},...,{R_k : \rel(A_k,B_k)}$, $(t_{\overline{A}},
  t'_{\overline{B}})$ is a morphism from $\relsem{\Gamma;
    \overline\alpha \vdash F} \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ to
  $\relsem{\Gamma ; \overline\alpha \vdash G}
  \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ in $\rel$.  To prove that this
  is equal to $\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash
      \Nat^{\overline\alpha} \,F\,G} \rho}$ we need to show that
  $(t_{\overline{A}}, t'_{\overline{B}})$ is a morphism from
  $\relsem{\Gamma; \overline\alpha \vdash F}
  \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ to $\relsem{\Gamma ;
    \overline\alpha \vdash G} \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ in
  $\rel$ for all ${R_1 : \rel(A_1,B_1)},...,{R_k : \rel(A_k,B_k)}$ if
  and only if $t = t'$ and $(t_{\overline{A}}, t_{\overline{B}})$ is a
  morphism from $\relsem{\Gamma; \overline\alpha \vdash F}
  \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ to $\relsem{\Gamma ; \overline
    \alpha \vdash G} \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ in $\rel$ for
  all ${R_1 : \rel(A_1,B_1)}, ...,$ ${R_k : \rel(A_k,B_k)}$. The only
  interesting part of this equivalence is to show that if
  $(t_{\overline{A}}, t'_{\overline{B}})$ is a morphism from
  $\relsem{\Gamma; \overline\alpha \vdash F}
  \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ to $\relsem{\Gamma ;
    \overline\alpha \vdash G} \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := R]}$ in
  $\rel$ for all ${R_1 : \rel(A_1,B_1),}$ $...,{R_k : \rel(A_k,B_k)}$,
  then $t = t'$.  By hypothesis, $(t_{\overline{A}},
  t'_{\overline{A}})$ is a morphism from $\relsem{\Gamma;
    \overline\alpha \vdash F} \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha :=
      \Eq_{A}]}$ to $\relsem{\Gamma ; \overline\alpha \vdash G}
  \Eq_{\rho}\overline{[\alpha := \Eq_{A}]}$ in $\rel$ for all
  $A_1\,...\,A_k : \set$. By the induction hypothesis, it is therefore
  a morphism from $\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \overline\alpha \vdash F}
    \rho\overline{[\alpha := A]}}$ to $\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma ;
      \overline\alpha \vdash G} \rho\overline{[\alpha := A]}}$ in
  $\rel$. This means that, for every $x : \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma;
      \overline\alpha \vdash F} \rho\overline{[\alpha := A]}}$,
  $t_{\overline{A}}x = t'_{\overline{A}}x$.  Then, by extensionality,
  $t = t'$.
\item $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \zerot} \Eq_{\rho} = 0_\rel =
  \Eq_{0_\set} = \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \zerot}\rho}$
\item $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \onet} \Eq_{\rho} = 1_\rel =
  \Eq_{1_\set} = \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \onet}\rho}$
\item The application case is proved by the following sequence of
  equalities, where the second equality is by the induction hypothesis
  and the definition of the relation environment $\Eq_\rho$, the third
  is by the definition of application of relation transformers, and
  the fourth is by Lemma~\ref{lem:eq-reln-equalities}:
\[
\begin{split}
\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}}\Eq_{\rho} &=
(\Eq_{\rho}\phi)\ol{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}
\Eq_{\rho}}\\
&= \Eq_{\rho \phi}\, \ol{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}
  \rho}}\\
&= (\Eq_{\rho \phi})^* \,\ol{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}
  \rho}}\\
&= \Eq_{(\rho \phi) \,\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau} \rho}}\\
&= \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \phi\ol{\tau}}\rho}
\end{split}
\]
\item The fixpoint case is proven by the sequence of equalities
\[
\begin{split}
\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi.\lambda
  \ol{\alpha}. H)\ol{\tau}}\Eq_{\rho} 
&=(\mu {T_{\Eq_{\rho}}}) \,\ol{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\Eq_{\rho}}\\ 
&= \colim{n \in \nat}{T^n_{\Eq_{\rho}} K_0}\, \ol{\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi
  \vdash \tau}\Eq_{\rho}}\\

&= \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash (\mu \phi.\lambda
      \ol{\alpha}. H)\ol{\tau}}\rho}
\end{split}
\]
Here, the third equality is by induction hypothesis, the fifth is by
Lemma~\ref{lem:eq-reln-equalities} and the fourth equality is because,
for every $n \in \nat$, the following two statements can be proved by
simultaneous induction:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate1}
T^n_{\Eq_{\rho}} K_0\, \ol{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
      \tau}\rho}} = (\Eq_{(T^\set_\rho)^n K_0})^*
\ol{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate2}
\begin{split}
  \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H}
\Eq_{\rho} [\phi := 
 & T^{n}_{\Eq_{\rho}} K_0] \overline{[\alpha :=
    \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}]} \\
=\;\; & \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H} \Eq_{\rho} [\phi
  := \Eq_{(T^\set_\rho)^n K_0}] \overline{[\alpha :=
    \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}]}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We prove~\eqref{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate1}.  The case $n=0$ is
trivial, because $T^0_{\Eq_{\rho}} K_0 = K_0$ and
$(T^\set_\rho)^0 K_0 = K_0$; the inductive step is
proved by the following sequence of equalities:
\[
\begin{split}
T^{n+1}_{\Eq_{\rho}} K_0\, \overline{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}}
&= T^\rel_{\Eq_{\rho}} (T^{n}_{\Eq_{\rho}} K_0)
\overline{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}} \\ 
&= \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H} \Eq_{\rho} [\phi

&= \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H} \Eq_{\rho} [\phi

&= \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi, \phi, \ol{\alpha} \vdash H} \rho [\phi
    := (T^\set_\rho)^n K_0] \overline{[\alpha :=

&= \Eq_{(T^\set_\rho)^{n+1} K_0 \overline{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
      \vdash \tau}\rho}} \\ 
&= (\Eq_{(T^\set_\rho)^{n+1} K_0})^*\, \overline{\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma;
      \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}} 
\end{split}
\]
Here, the third equality is by~\eqref{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate2},
the fifth by the induction hypothesis on $H$, and the last by
Lemma~\ref{lem:eq-reln-equalities}.  We prove the induction step
of~\eqref{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate2} by structural induction on
$H$: the only interesting case, though, is when $\phi$ is applied,
i.e., for $H = \phi \ol{\sigma}$, which is proved by the sequence of
equalities:
\[
\begin{split}

  \overline{[\alpha := \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \tau}\rho}]} 
\end{split}
\]
Here, the second equality is by the induction hypothesis
for~\eqref{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate2} on the $\sigma$s, the
fourth is by the induction hypothesis for Theorem~\ref{thm:iel} on the
$\sigma$s, and the fifth is by the induction hypothesis on $n$
for~\eqref{eq:iel-fix-point-intermediate1}.

From the IEL we get a Graph Lemma, {\color{red} also proved in the
  appendix:} 
\begin{lemma}%[Graph Lemma]
  \label{lem:graph}
  If $\rho, \rho' : \setenv$ and $f : \rho \to \rho'$
  %, and $\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F$,
  then $\graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f} =
\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
Applying Equation~\ref{lem:rel-transf-morph} to the morphisms $(f,
\id_{\rho'}) : \graph{f} \to \Eq_{\rho'}$ and $(\id_{\rho}, f) :
\Eq_{\rho} \to \graph{f}$ of relation environments gives that
$(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\id_{\rho'}) = \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} (f, \id_{\rho'}) :
\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f} \to \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi
  \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho'}$ and $(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\id_{\rho}, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f) = \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F} (\id_{\rho}, f) : \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\Eq_{\rho} \to \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$.
Expanding the first equation gives that if $(x,y) \in \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$ then $(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\,
x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho'}\, y) \in \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho'}$. So $\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\id_{\rho'}\, y = \id_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho'}\, y =
y$ and $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho'} =
\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho'}$, and if $(x,y) \in
\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$ then $(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
  \vdash F} f\, x, y) \in \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho'}$,
i.e., $\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x = y$, i.e., $(x, y) \in
\graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f}$.  So, we have that
$\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f} \subseteq
\graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f}$.  Expanding the second
equation gives that if $x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$ then
$(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho}\, x,$\\
$\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
  \vdash F} f\, x) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$.  Then
$\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho}\, x = \id_{\setsem{\Gamma;
    \Phi \vdash F}\rho} x = x$, so for any $x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
  \vdash F}\rho$ we have that $(x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f\,
x) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$.  Moreover, $x \in
\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$ if and only if $(x,
\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in \graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
    \vdash F}f}$ and, if $x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$
then $(x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F} \graph{f}$, so if $(x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}
f\, x) \in \graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f}$ then $(x,
\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F} \graph{f}$, i.e., $\graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f}
\subseteq \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} \graph{f}$.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}


\begin{comment}

\begin{proof}
First observe that $(f, \id_{\rho'}) : \graph{f} \to \Eq_{\rho'}$ and
$(\id_{\rho}, f) : \Eq_{\rho} \to \graph{f}$ are morphisms of relation
environments.  Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:rel-transf-morph} to each of
these observations gives that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:graph-one}
(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
    F}\id_{\rho'}) = \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} (f, \id_{\rho'}) :
  \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f} \to \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi
    \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho'}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:graph-two}
(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho}, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f)
= \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} (\id_{\rho}, f)
: \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho} \to \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}
\end{equation}
Expanding Equation~\ref{eq:graph-one} gives that if
$(x,y) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$
then
\[(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\id_{\rho'}\, y) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho'}\]
Observe that $\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho'}\, y =
\id_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho'}\, y = y$ and
$\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\Eq_{\rho'} = \Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
    \vdash F}\rho'}$. So, if $(x,y) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\graph{f}$ then $(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x, y) \in
\Eq_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho'}$, i.e., $\setsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F} f\, x = y$, i.e., $(x, y) \in \graph{\setsem{\Gamma;
    \Phi \vdash F} f}$.  So, we have that $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\graph{f} \subseteq \graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f}$

Expanding Equation~\ref{eq:graph-two} gives that, for any
$x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$,
then
\[
(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho}\, x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi
  \vdash F} f\, x) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f} 
\]
Observe that $\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\id_{\rho}\, x =
\id_{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho} x = x$ so, for any $x \in
\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$, we have that $(x, \setsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F}f\, x) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f}$.
Moreover, $x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$ if and only if
$(x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in \graph{\setsem{\Gamma;
    \Phi \vdash F}f}$ and, if $x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\rho$ then $(x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in
\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} \graph{f}$, so if $(x, \setsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in \graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f}$
then $(x, \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} f\, x) \in \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash F} \graph{f}$, i.e., $\graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
    F}f} \subseteq \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} \graph{f}$. We
conclude that $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\graph{f} =
\graph{\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}f}$ as desired.

\section{Interpreting Terms}\label{sec:term-interp}

\vspace*{-0.1in}

If $\Delta = x_1 : F_1,...,x_n : F_n$ is a term context for $\Gamma$
and $\Phi$, define 
%, then the interpretations $\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
%  \Delta}$ and $\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta}$ are defined by
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
$\sem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta}^{\mathsf{D}} = \sem{\Gamma;\Phi
  \vdash F_1}^{\mathsf{D}} \times ... \times \sem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
  F_n}^{\mathsf{D}}$,
%\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta} & = & \relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash
%  F_1} \times ... \times \relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash F_n}\\ 
%\end{array}\]
where $\mathsf D$ is $\set$ or $\rel$ as appropriate. Then every
well-formed term has a set (resp., relational) interpretation as a
natural transformation from the set (resp., relational) interpretation
of its term context to that of its type. These interpretations, given
in Figure~\ref{fig:term-sem}, respect weakening, so that
%, i.e., a term and its weakenings all have the same set and
%relational interpretations.
if $\rho : \setenv$ then $\sem{\Gamma;\Phi \,|\, \Delta, x : F
  \vdash t : G}^{\mathsf D}\rho = (\sem{\Gamma;\Phi \,|\, \Delta
  \vdash t : G}^{\mathsf D}\rho) \circ \pi_{\Delta}$, where
$\pi_{\Delta}$ is the projection $\sem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta, x :
  F}^{\mathsf D} \to \sem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta}^{\mathsf D}$.



\begin{comment}
Every well-formed term $\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F$ then has,
for every $\rho \in \setenv$, set interpretations
$\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}\rho$ as natural
transformations from $\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \Delta}\rho$ to
$\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho$, and, for every $\rho \in
\relenv$, relational interpretations $\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta
  \vdash t : F}\rho$ as natural transformations from $\relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash \Delta}\rho$ to $\relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash
  F}\rho$. These are given in Figure~\ref{fig:set-interp}, where
$\mathsf D$ is either $\set$ or $\rel$ as appropriate.

\begin{definition}\label{def:set-interp}
If $\rho$ is a set (resp., relation) environment and
$\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F$ then
$\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}\rho$ (resp.,
$\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}\rho$) is defined as in
Figure~\ref{fig:term-sem}, where $\mathsf D$ is either $\set$ or
$\rel$ as appropriate.

This interpretation gives that $\relsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\, \Delta

If $t$ is closed, i.e., if $\emptyset; \emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash t
: \tau$, then we write $\setsem{\vdash t : \tau}$ instead of
$\setsem{\emptyset; \emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash t : \tau}$.

\[ \relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \,|\, \Delta, x : \sigma \vdash t : \tau}\rho
  = (\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \,|\, \Delta \vdash t : \tau}\rho) \circ
  \pi_{\Delta}\] where $\pi_{\Delta}$ is the projection
  $\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta, x : \sigma} \to
  \relsem{\Gamma;\Phi \vdash \Delta}$.
\end{comment}

The return type for the semantic fold is
  $\dsem{\Gamma;\ol\beta,\ol\gamma \vdash F}\rho[\ol{\gamma :=
    C}][\ol{\beta := B}]$.
  This interpretation gives $\dsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\, \Delta
    \vdash \lambda x.t : F \to G}\rho = \curry
  (\dsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\, \Delta, x : F \vdash t :
    G}\rho)$ and $\dsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash st:
    G} \rho = \eval \circ \langle \dsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\,
    \Delta \vdash s: F \to G}\rho, \dsem{\Gamma;\emptyset
    \,|\, \Delta \vdash t: F}\rho \rangle$, so it specializes to
  the standard interpretations for System F terms.  If $t$ is closed,
  i.e., if $\emptyset; \emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash t : F$, then we
  write $\dsem{\vdash t : F}$ instead of $\dsem{\emptyset;
    \emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash t : F}$.
%, and similarly for $\relsem{\emptyset; \emptyset~|~\emptyset \vdash
%t : \tau}$.
  In addition, term interpretation respects substitution for both
  functorial and non-functorial type variables, as well as term
  substitution.

Define, for $\Gamma; \ol{\alpha} \vdash F$, the term $\id_F$ to be

x. s_{\overline{\alpha}}(t_{\overline{\alpha}}x):
\Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,H$. Then $\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\,

\id_{\lambda \ol{A}. \setsem{\Gamma; \ol{\alpha} \vdash F} \rho

  \Delta \vdash s: \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} G\,H} \circ
\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash t:
  \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,G}$. Straightforward calculation shows
that terms of $\Nat$ type behave as natural transformations with
respect to their source and target functorial types, i.e., we have

  \vspace*{-0.1in}
  
\noindent
Theorem~\ref{eq:ft-from-nat} gives a family of free theorems that are
consequences of naturality, and thus do not require the full power of
parametricity. All of Wadler's free theorems apart from short cut
fusion are in this family. We can also prove that the interpretation
of every $\map_G$ is a functor, and that $\map$ is itself a
higher-order functor. For example, the former property can be stated as:
%\begin{theorem}\label{eq:ft-functoriality}
  if 
$\Gamma; \ol\alpha, \ol\gamma \vdash H$, 
  $\ol{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash g : \Nat^{\ol\gamma} F \, G}$, and
  $\ol{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash f : \Nat^{\ol\gamma} G \, K}$, then

  \vspace*{-0.25in}

\end{align*}
%\end{theorem}

    \vspace*{-0.1in}

We also have the expected properties of the interpretations of $\map$,
$\tin$, and $\fold$, namely the uniqueness and universal property of
the interpretation of $\fold$ and the fact that the interpretation of
$\tin$ is an isomorphism.

Theorem~\ref{eq:ft-from-nat} gives a family of free theorems that are
consequences of naturality, and thus do not require the full power of
parametricity. Other specific instances include the three
$\mathtt{map}$/$\mathtt{reverse}$ theorems from
Section~\ref{sec:intro}. The $\mathtt{map}$/$\mathtt{reverse}$ theorem
for bushes, e.g., is
\begin{align*}
  &\setsem{\emptyset; \emptyset~|~ y : \Nat^\emptyset F \, G
    \vdash ((\map_{\mathit{Bush}\,\alpha}^{{F},
      {G}}P)_\emptyset\, y) \circ (L_{{\emptyset}}

           {y}) : \Nat^{\emptyset} (\mathit{Bush} \, F ) \,
           (\mathit{Bush} \, G)}
\end{align*}
for any term $\vdash \mathit{reverseBush} : \Nat^\alpha (\mathit{Bush}
\,\alpha) \, (\mathit{Bush} \, \alpha)$. We can also prove a theorem
for the data type $\emptyset;\alpha,\gamma \vdash
\mathit{Tree}\,\alpha\,\gamma$ from Section~\ref{sec:calculus} that is
similar but only maps along some of its functorial variables:
%  \begin{align*}
%  &\setsem{\emptyset; \alpha~|~ y : \Nat^\emptyset \sigma \, \tau
%    \vdash ((\map_{\mathit{PTree}\,\alpha}^{{\sigma},

%Note this instance uses the following version of map:

%\Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^\gamma \, \sigma \,\tau)\,
%(\Nat^\gamma(\mathit{Tree}\,\sigma\,\gamma)\,(\mathit{Tree}\,\tau\,\gamma))$$
%as opposed to 
%$$\map_{\mathit{Tree} \,\alpha \, \gamma}^{\sigma, \sigma', \tau, \tau'} : 
%\Nat^{\emptyset} ((\Nat^\emptyset \, \sigma \,\tau) \times
%(\Nat^\emptyset\,\sigma'\,\tau')) \,
%(\Nat^\emptyset\,(\mathit{Tree}\,\sigma\,\sigma')\,(\mathit{Tree}\,\tau\,\tau'))$$
We observed in Section~\ref{sec:calculus} that $ \phi; \alpha \vdash
\mathit{GRose}\,\phi\,\alpha$ cannot appear as the (co)domain of a
$\Nat$-type binding both $\phi$ and $\alpha$. As a result, there are
no instances of, say, a $\mathtt{map}$/$\mathtt{reverse}$ free theorem
for this data type that maps replacements for both $\phi$ and
$\alpha$. On the other hand, $\phi; \alpha \vdash
\mathit{GRose}\,\phi\,\alpha$ does support a
$\mathtt{map}$/$\mathtt{reverse}$ theorem that maps only a replacement
for $\alpha$.

Analogous results hold for relation environments and relational
interpretations.



\subsection{Properties of Initial Algebraic Constructs}\label{sec:iaps}

\subsection{Free Theorems Derived from Naturality}\label{sec:ft-nat}

In our setting, free theorems of a certain familiar form are derivable
directly from the semantic properties of $\Nat$-types. Indeed, the
following theorem is immediate from Equation~\ref{thm:subst}, by taking
$\gamma$ to be empty, expanding the interpretations on the left- and
right-hand sides, and using the fact from Section~\ref{sec:iaps} that
$\map$ terms are interpreted as semantic $\mathit{map}$ functions:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:ft-nat}
If\, $\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash F : \F$,\, $\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash G :
\F$, $\rho : \setenv$, $x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^{\ol\alpha} F\, G } \rho$, and, for vectors of length
$|\ol\alpha|$, \, $\ol{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \sigma : \F}$,\,
$\ol{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \tau: \F}$, and $\ol{y \in
  \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau }
  \rho}$, then
\[\mathit{map}_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash G} \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \ol{y}
  \circ x_{\ol{{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \sigma} \rho}}} =
  x_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \tau} \rho} } \circ
  \mathit{map}_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash F} \rho[\ol{\alpha :=
        \_}]} \, \ol{y}\]
\end{theorem}
\noindent
%INCORRECT
%In particular, for $\ol{A, B: \set}$, variables $\ol{v}$ and $\ol{w}$
%with $\ol{\rho v = A}$ and $\ol{\rho w = B}$, and functions $\ol{f : A
%  \to B}$, the following holds: $\mathit{map}_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash G}
%  \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \ol{f} \circ x_{\ol{A}} = x_{\ol{B}} \circ
%\mathit{map}_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash F} \rho[\ol{\alpha :=
%      \_}]} \, \ol{f}$.
A similar result holds for relational interpretations.

Specific instances of Theorem~\ref{thm:ft-nat} include {\color{blue}
  Wadler free theorems, map-reverse theorems from intro, ???}
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
We already know from Equation~\ref{thm:subst} that 
\begin{multline}
\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x :
  \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}, 
    \overline{\gamma}} F\,G, \overline{y : \Nat^{\overline{\gamma}}
    \sigma\, \tau} \vdash ((\map_G^{\overline{\sigma},
    \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset} \overline{y}) \circ
  (L_{\overline{\gamma}} z. x_{\overline{\sigma}, \overline{\gamma}}
  z) : \Nat^{\overline{\gamma}} F[\overline{\alpha := \sigma}]\,
  G[\overline{\alpha := \tau}]} \\
= \setsem{ \Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x
  : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}, \overline{\gamma}} F\, G, \overline{y :
    \Nat^{\overline{\gamma}} \sigma\, \tau} \vdash
  (L_{\overline{\gamma}} z. x_{\overline{\tau}, \overline{\gamma}} z)
  \circ ((\map_F^{\overline{\sigma}, \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset}
  \overline{y}) : \Nat^{\overline{\gamma}} F[\overline{\alpha :=
      \sigma}]\, G[\overline{\alpha := \tau}]}
\end{multline}

In particular, for any set environment $\rho$, natural transformation 
$x \in \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\ol\alpha} F\, G } \rho$, and functions
$\ol{y \in \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau } \rho}$
(thus specializing to the case where there are no $\gamma$’s), we have
\begin{multline}
\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x :
  \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,G, \overline{y : \Nat^{\emptyset}
    \sigma\, \tau} \vdash ((\map_G^{\overline{\sigma},
    \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset} \overline{y}) \circ
  (L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\sigma}}
  z) : \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\overline{\alpha := \sigma}]\,
  G[\overline{\alpha := \tau}]} \rho (x, \ol{y}) \\
= \setsem{ \Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x
  : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\, G, \overline{y :
    \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau} \vdash
  (L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\tau}} z)
  \circ ((\map_F^{\overline{\sigma}, \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset}
  \overline{y}) : \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\overline{\alpha :=
      \sigma}]\, G[\overline{\alpha := \tau}]} \rho (x, \ol{y})
\end{multline}

Unwinding these interpretations yields
\begin{multline}
\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x :
  \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,G, \overline{y : \Nat^{\emptyset}
    \sigma\, \tau} \vdash ((\map_G^{\overline{\sigma},
    \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset} \overline{y}) \circ
  (L_\emptyset z. x_{\overline{\sigma}}
  z) : \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\overline{\alpha := \sigma}]\,
  G[\overline{\alpha := \tau}]} \rho \, (x , \ol{y}) \\
= 
\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,G, 
  \overline{y : \Nat^{\emptyset}
    \sigma\, \tau} \vdash (\map_G^{\overline{\sigma},
    \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset} \overline{y} } \rho \, (x, \ol{y})
   \circ
  \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,G 
   , \overline{y : \Nat^{\emptyset}
      \sigma\, \tau} \vdash
   L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\sigma}}
  z } \rho \, (x, \ol{y}) \\
= 
\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, \overline{y : \Nat^{\emptyset}
    \sigma\, \tau} \vdash (\map_G^{\overline{\sigma},
    \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset} \overline{y} } \rho \, \ol{y}
   \circ
  \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\,G \vdash
    L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\sigma}}
  z } \rho \, x \\
= \map_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash G} \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \ol{y}
  \circ 
  x_{\ol{{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \sigma} \rho}}}
\end{multline}


and 
\begin{multline}
\setsem{ \Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x
  : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\, G, \overline{y :
    \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau} \vdash
  (L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\tau}} z)
  \circ ((\map_F^{\overline{\sigma}, \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset}
  \overline{y}) : \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\overline{\alpha :=
      \sigma}]\, G[\overline{\alpha := \tau}]} \rho (x, \ol{y}) \\
=
\setsem{ \Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x
  : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\, G, \overline{y :
    \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau} \vdash
  L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\tau}} z)} \rho (x, \ol{y})
  \circ 
  \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset
  \,|\, x : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\, G, \overline{y :
    \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau} \vdash 
  (\map_F^{\overline{\sigma}, \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset}
  \overline{y} } \rho (x, \ol{y}) \\
= \setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \,|\, x
  : \Nat^{\overline{\alpha}} F\, G \vdash 
  L_{\emptyset} z. x_{\overline{\tau}} z} \rho \, x
  \circ 
  \setsem{\Gamma;\emptyset \,|\, \overline{y :
    \Nat^{\emptyset} \sigma\, \tau} \vdash
    (\map_F^{\overline{\sigma}, \overline{\tau}})_{\emptyset}
  \overline{y} } \rho \, \ol{y}  \\
  = x_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \tau} \rho} }
  \circ \map_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash F} 
    \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \, \ol{y}
\end{multline}


So, we can conclude that
\begin{equation}
\map_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash G} \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \ol{y}
  \circ 
  x_{\ol{{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \sigma} \rho}}}
= x_{\ol{\setsem{\Gamma; \emptyset \vdash \tau} \rho} }
\circ \map_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash F} 
  \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \, \ol{y}
\end{equation}

Moreover, for any $\ol{A, B: \set}$,
we can choose $\ol{\sigma = v}$ and $\ol{\tau = w}$ to be variables such that
$\ol{\rho v = A}$ and $\ol{\rho w = B}$.
Then for any functions $\ol{f : A \to B}$ we have that
\begin{equation}
\map_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash G} \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \ol{f}
  \circ 
  x_{\ol{A}}
  = x_{\ol{B}}
\circ \map_{\setsem{\Gamma; \ol\alpha \vdash F} 
  \rho[\ol{\alpha := \_}]} \, \ol{f}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\subsection{The Abstraction Theorem}\label{sec:thms} 

To go beyond naturality and get {\em all} consequences of
parametricity, we prove an Abstraction Theorem. As usual for such
theorems, we prove a more general result (Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen})
for possibly open terms. We recover our Abstraction Theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:abstraction}) as the special case of
Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen} for closed terms of closed type.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:at-gen}
Every well-formed term $\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F$ induces
a natural transformation from $\sem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \Delta}$ to
$\sem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}$, i.e., a triple of natural
transformations 
\[(\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F},\,
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F},\,
\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F})\]
where
\[\begin{array}{lll}
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F} & : & \setsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash \Delta} \to \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}
\end{array}\]
has as its component at $\rho : \setenv$ a morphism
\[\begin{array}{lll}
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}\rho & : & \setsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash \Delta}\rho \to \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho
\end{array}\]
in $\set$,
\[\begin{array}{lll}
\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F} & : & \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash \Delta} \to \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}
\end{array}\]
has as its component at $\rho : \relenv$ a morphism
\[\begin{array}{lll}
\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}\rho & : & \relsem{\Gamma;
  \Phi \vdash \Delta}\rho \to \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F}\rho
\end{array}\]
in $\rel$,
and, for all $\rho : \relenv$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:projs}
\relsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}\rho =
(\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}(\pi_1 \rho),\,
\setsem{\Gamma;\Phi~|~\Delta \vdash t : F}(\pi_2 \rho))
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By structural induction on the type judgment for $t$. The overall
challenge of our development manifests in this proof. It lies in
showing that the set and relational interpretations of each term
judgment are natural transformations, and that all set interpretations
of terms of $\Nat$-types satisfy the appropriate equality preservation
conditions from Figure~\ref{fig:set-sem}.  For the interesting
cases of abstraction, application, $\map$, $\tin$, and $\mathsf{fold}$ terms,
propagating the naturality conditions is quite involved; the latter
two cases especially require some rather delicate diagram
chasing. That this is possible provides strong evidence that our
definitions and development are sensible, natural, and at an
appropriate level of abstraction. {\color{red} Detailed proofs for the
  set interpretations for the five interesting forms of terms are
  included in the accompanying anonymous supplementary material. Even
  in the supplementary material we omit the other, straightforward,
  cases.}  The proofs for the relational interpretations of all term
judgments are entirely analogous to the proofs for their set
interpretations. The proof that Equation~\ref{eq:projs} holds in each
case is by direct calculation, using the facts that projections are
surjective and that the set and relational interpretations are defined
``in parallel'', i.e., are fibred.
\end{proof}

The following theorem is an immediate consequence of
Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen}:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:at-gen-rel}
  If
  %\,$\Gamma; \Phi \,|\, \Delta \vdash t : F$ and \,
  $\rho \in \relenv$,
  and \,$(a, b) \in \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash \Delta} \rho$,
  then\\
  $(\setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \,|\, \Delta \vdash t : F} (\pi_1 \rho) \,a \, ,
      \setsem{\Gamma; \Phi \,|\, \Delta \vdash t : F } (\pi_2 \rho) \,b) \in 
    \relsem{\Gamma; \Phi \vdash F} \rho$
\end{theorem}
\noindent
Finally, the Abstraction Theorem is the instantiation of
Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen-rel} to closed terms of closed type:
\begin{theorem}[Abstraction Theorem]\label{thm:abstraction}
  %If $\vdash t : F$, then
  $(\setsem{\vdash t : F},\setsem{\vdash t
  : F}) \in \relsem{\vdash F}$
\end{theorem}

\section{Free Theorems for Nested Types}\label{sec:ftnt}

In this section we show how Theorem~\ref{thm:abstraction} can be used
to prove more advanced free theorems than those of
Section~\ref{sec:Nat-type-terms} in the presence of directly
constructed nested types.

\subsection{Free Theorem for Type of Polymorphic
  Bottom}\label{sec:bottom} 

Let $ \vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \,\onet\,\alpha$, let $G^\set =
\setsem{\vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \,\onet\,\alpha}$ and $G^\rel =
\relsem{\vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \,\onet\,\alpha}$.  By
Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen}, $(G^\set(\pi_1\rho),G^\set(\pi_2\rho))
= G^\rel\rho$. Thus, for all $\rho \in \relenv$ and any $(a, b) \in
\relsem{\vdash \emptyset}\rho = 1$, eliding the only possible
instantiations of $a$ and $b$ gives that
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
$(G^\set,G^\set) \;= \; (G^\set(\pi_1 \rho), G^\set (\pi_2 \rho))$
$ \in  \relsem{\vdash \Nat^\alpha \,\onet\,\alpha}\rho$
$ =  \{\eta : K_1 \Rightarrow \id\}$
$ =  \{(\eta_1 : K_1 \Rightarrow \id, \eta_2 : K_1 \Rightarrow
\id)\}$ 
%\end{array}\]
That is, $G^\set$ is a natural transformation from the constantly
$1$-valued functor to the identity functor in $\set$. In particular,
for every $S : \set$, $G^\set_S : 1 \to S$. Note, however, that if $S
= \emptyset$, then there can be no such morphism, so no such natural
transformation,
%in $\set$,
and thus no term $\vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \onet \,\alpha$, can exist.
%in our calculus.
That is, our calculus admits no non-terminating terms, i.e., terms
with the closed type $\Nat^\alpha \onet \,\alpha$ of the polymorphic
bottom.

\subsection{Free Theorem for Type of Polymorphic
  Identity}\label{sec:identity} 

Let $ \vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \,\alpha\,\alpha$, \/$G^\set =
\setsem{\vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \,\alpha\,\alpha}$, and $G^\rel =
\relsem{\vdash g : \Nat^\alpha \,\alpha\,\alpha}$.  By
Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen}, $(G^\set(\pi_1\rho),G^\set(\pi_2\rho))
= G^\rel\rho$. Thus, for all $\rho :\relenv$ and any $(a, b) \in
\relsem{\vdash \emptyset}\rho = 1$, eliding the only possible
instantiations of $a$ and $b$ gives that
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
$(G^\set, G^\set) \; = \; (G^\set(\pi_1 \rho), G^\set (\pi_2 \rho))$
$ \in \relsem{\vdash \Nat^\alpha \,\alpha\,\alpha}\rho$
$ =  \{\eta : \id \Rightarrow \id\}$
$ =  \{(\eta_1 : \id \Rightarrow \id, \eta_2 : \id \Rightarrow
\id)\}$
%\end{array}\]
That is, $G^\set$ is a natural transformation from the identity
functor on $\set$ to itself. Now let $S$ be any set.  If $S =
\emptyset$, then there is exactly one morphism $\id_S: S \to S$, so
$G^\set_S : S \to S$ must be $\id_S$. If $S \not = \emptyset$, if
$a$ is any element of $S$, and if $K_a :S \to S$ is the constantly
$a$-valued morphism on $S$, then instantiating the naturality square
implied by the above equality gives that $G^\set_S \circ K_a = K_a
\circ G^\set_S$, i.e., $G^\set_S \, a = a$, i.e., $G^\set_S = \id_S$.
Putting these two cases together we have that for every $S : \set$,
$G^\set_S = \id_S$, i.e., $G^\set$ is the identity natural
transformation for the identity functor on $\set$. So every closed
term $g$ of closed type $\Nat^\alpha\alpha\,\alpha$ always denotes the
identity natural transformation for the identity functor on $\set$,
i.e., every closed term $g$ of type $\Nat^\alpha\alpha\,\alpha$
denotes the polymorphic identity function.

\subsection{Standard Free Theorems for ADTs and Their Analogues for
  Nested types}\label{sec:ft-adt}

We can derive in our calculus even those free theorems for polymorphic
functions over ADTs that are not consequences of naturality.  We can,
e.g., prove the free theorem for $\mathit{filter}$'s type as follows:

%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:list-graph}
%If $g : A \to B$, $\rho : \relenv$, and $\rho\alpha = (A, B,
%\graph{g})$, then $\relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha}
%\rho = \graph{map_{\mathit{List}} \, g}$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%The result follows by straightforward calculation using
%Definition~\ref{def:rel-sem} and Equation~\ref{eq:mu}, together with
%the facts that $\mathit{List} \,(A, B, \graph{g}) =
%\graph{\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g}$ and, if $H = \onet + \beta
%\times\phi \beta$ {\color{blue} Why not $H = \onet + \alpha \times
%  \beta$? Does it matter?}, then $(T_{H,\rho}^n K_0)^* R =
%\Sigma_{i=0}^n R^i$ for all $n \in \nat$ and $R \in \rel$ by induction
%on $n$.
%\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} 
If $g : A \to B$, $\rho : \relenv$, $\rho \alpha = (A, B, \graph{g})$,
$(a, b) \in \relsem{\alpha ;\emptyset \vdash \Delta} \rho$, $(s \circ
g, s) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset \alpha \,
  \mathit{Bool}} \rho$, and % for $s : A \to \mathit{Bool}$, and
%$\alpha; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash t :
%\filtype$, if
$\mathit{filter} = \setsem{\alpha; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash t :
  \filtype}$ for some $t$, then
\[  \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \circ \mathit{filter} \, (\pi_1
\rho) \, a \, (s \circ g) = \mathit{filter}\, (\pi_2\rho) \, b \, s
\circ \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen-rel}, \[(\mathit{filter}\, (\pi_1 \rho)\, a,
\mathit{filter}\, (\pi_2 \rho)\, b) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset
  \vdash \filtype} \rho\] so if $(s', s) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset
  \vdash \Nat^\emptyset \alpha \, \mathit{Bool}} \rho = \rho\alpha \to
\Eq_{\mathit{Bool}}$ and $(xs', xs) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset
  \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho$ then
% then
%  \begin{align*}
%    (t (\pi_1 \rho) \,a \,s, t (\pi_2 \rho) \,b \,s') &\in \relsem{\alpha; \emptys%et \vdash \Nat^\emptyset (List \, \alpha) \, (List \, \alpha)} \rho \\
%   &= \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho \to \relsem{\alpha; \e%mptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho \\
%  \end{align*}
%  So if $(xs, xs') \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho$ then,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filter-thm-list}
  (\mathit{filter}\, (\pi_1\rho) \,a \,s' \,xs', \mathit{filter} \,
  (\pi_2\rho) \,b \,s \,xs) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash
    \mathit{List} \, \alpha} \rho
\end{equation}
If $\rho\alpha = (A, B, \graph{g})$, then $\relsem{\alpha; \emptyset
  \vdash \mathit{List} \, \alpha} \rho =
\graph{\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \, g}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:graph}
and Equation~\ref{thm:demotion-objects}.  Moreover, $xs =
\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \,xs'$ and $(s', s) \in \graph{g} \to
\Eq_{\mathit{Bool}}$, so $s' = s \circ g$. The result
follows from % Instantiating
Equation~\ref{eq:filter-thm-list}.\end{proof}
%gives the result.
% \begin{align*}
%    &(t (\pi_1\rho) \,a \,(s' \circ g) \,xs, t (\pi_2\rho) \,b \,s' \,(\mathit{map%}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \,xs)) \in \graph{\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g}, \\ 
%    & i.e., \\ 
%    &\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \, (t (\pi_1\rho) \,a \,(s' \circ g) \,xs) =% t (\pi_2\rho) \,b \,s' \,(\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \,xs), \\ 
%    & i.e., \\
%    &\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \circ t (\pi_1 \rho) \, a \, (s' \circ g) = %t (\pi_2\rho) \, b \, s' \circ \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g
%  \end{align*}
%  as desired.
%\end{proof}

\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
\begin{theorem} 
  If $g : A \to B$, 
  $\rho : \relenv$, 
  $\rho \alpha = (A, B, \graph{g})$,
  $(a, b) \in \relsem{\alpha ;\emptyset \vdash \Delta} \rho$, 
  $(s \circ g, s) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset \alpha \, \mathit{Bool}} \rho$,
  and, for some well-formed term $\mathit{filter}$, \\
  $$t = \setsem{\alpha; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta \vdash \mathit{filter} : \filtype} \emph{, then }$$
  \begin{align*}
  \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \circ t (\pi_1 \rho) \, a \, (s \circ g) = t (\pi_2\rho) \, b \, s \circ \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By Theorem~\ref{thm:at-gen-rel},
  $(t (\pi_1 \rho) a, t (\pi_2 \rho) b) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash \filtype} \rho$.
  Thus if 
  $(s, s') \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset \alpha \, \mathit{Bool}} \rho = \rho\alpha \to \Eq_{\mathit{Bool}}$,
  then 
  \begin{align*}
    (t (\pi_1 \rho) \,a \,s, t (\pi_2 \rho) \,b \,s') &\in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset (List \, \alpha) \, (List \, \alpha)} \rho \\
   &= \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho \to \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho \\
  \end{align*}
  So if $(xs, xs') \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho$ then,
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:filter-thm}
  (t (\pi_1\rho) \,a \,s \,xs, t (\pi_2\rho) \,b \,s' \,xs') \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho
  \end{equation}

  Consider the case in which $\rho\alpha = (A, B, \graph{g})$. Then $\relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash List \, \alpha} \rho
  = \graph{\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \, g}$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:list-graph}, and $(xs, xs') \in \graph{\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g}$ 
  implies $xs' = \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \,xs$. We also have that 
  $(s, s') \in \graph{g} \to \Eq_{\mathit{Bool}}$ implies 
  $\forall (x, g x) \in \graph{g}. \,\, s x = s' (g x)$ and thus
  $s = s' \circ g$ due to the definition of morphisms between relations.
  %% TODO show (s, s') \in <g> -> \mathit{Bool} implies s = s' \circ g %% 
  With these instantiations, Equation~\ref{eq:filter-thm} becomes
  \begin{align*}
    &(t (\pi_1\rho) \,a \,(s' \circ g) \,xs, t (\pi_2\rho) \,b \,s' \,(\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \,xs)) \in \graph{\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g}, \\ 
    & i.e., \\ 
    &\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \, (t (\pi_1\rho) \,a \,(s' \circ g) \,xs) = t (\pi_2\rho) \,b \,s' \,(\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \,xs), \\ 
    & i.e., \\
    &\mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g \circ t (\pi_1 \rho) \, a \, (s' \circ g) = t (\pi_2\rho) \, b \, s' \circ \mathit{map}_{\mathit{List}} \,g
  \end{align*}
  as desired.

%\subsection{Free Theorem for Type of $\mathit{filter}$ for
%  $\GRose$}\label{sec:filter-grose} 

A similar proof establishes the analogous result for, say, generalized
rose trees. 
\begin{theorem} 
  If $g : A \to B$,
$F, G : \set \to \set$,
  $\eta : F \to G$ in $\set$, $\rho : \relenv$, $\rho \alpha =
 (A, B, \graph{g})$, $\rho \psi = (F, G, \graph{\eta})$, $(a, b) \in
 \relsem{\alpha, \psi ;\emptyset \vdash \Delta} \rho$, $(s \circ
 g, s) \in \relsem{\alpha; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset \alpha \,
   \mathit{Bool}} \rho$, and
 \[ \mathit{filter} = \setsem{\alpha, \psi; \emptyset \,|\, \Delta
      \vdash t : \filtypeGRose}  \]
for some $t$, then
\[ \semmap_{\mathit{GRose}}\, \eta\, (g + 1) \circ \mathit{filter} \,
(\pi_1 \rho) \, a \, (s \circ g) = \mathit{filter} \, (\pi_2\rho) \, b
\, s \circ 
\semmap_{\mathit{GRose}}\, \eta\, g\]
\end{theorem}

\noindent
This is not surprising since rose trees are essentially
ADT-like. However, as noted in Section~\ref{sec:terms}, our calculus
cannot express the type of a polymorphic filter function for a proper
nested type.

\subsection{Short Cut Fusion for Lists}\label{sec:short-cut}
{\color{red} Remove section? Not mentioned in intro anymore.}


We can recover standard short cut fusion for lists~\cite{glp93} in our
calculus: 
\begin{theorem}
If \,$\vdash F$, $\vdash H$, and 
%$\beta; \emptyset \,|\, \emptyset \vdash g : \Nat^{\emptyset}
%(\Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet + \tau \times \beta)\, \beta)\, \beta$. 
%If
$G \, = \, \setsem{\beta; \emptyset \,|\, \emptyset \vdash g :
  \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet + F \times \beta)\,
  \beta)\, \beta}$ for some $g$, and if $c \in \setsem{\vdash F}
\,\times\, \setsem{\vdash H} \to \setsem{\vdash H}$ and $n \in
\setsem{\vdash H}$, then
\[\mathit{fold}_{1 + \setsem{\vdash F} \times \_}\, n\, c\; (G\; (\mathit{List}\,
\setsem{\vdash F})\,\mathit{nil} \,\mathit{cons}) = G \,\setsem{\vdash
  H}\, n\, c \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
%Let $\vdash \tau : \F$ and $\vdash \tau' : \F$, let
%\[\beta; \emptyset \,|\, \emptyset \vdash g : \Nat^{\emptyset}
%(\Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet + \tau \times \beta)\, \beta)\, \beta\]
%and let
%\[G = \setsem{\beta; \emptyset \,|\, \emptyset
%  \vdash g : \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet + \tau \times
  %  \beta)\, \beta)\, \beta}\] Then
Theorem~\ref{thm:abstraction} gives
that, for any $\rho : \relenv$,
%and any $(a, b) \in
%\relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \emptyset}\rho = 1$, then (eliding the
%only possible instantiations of $a$ and $b$) we have
\[(G \,(\pi_1 \rho), G\, (\pi_2 \rho))
 \in  \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset}
  (\onet + F \times \beta)\, \beta)\, \beta} \rho\\
\cong (((\relsem{\vdash F} \rho \times
\rho\beta) \to \rho\beta) \times \rho\beta) \to \rho\beta\] 
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
%(G \,(\pi_1 \rho), G\, (\pi_2 \rho))
% & \in & \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset}
%  (\onet + \tau \times \beta)\, \beta)\, \beta} \rho\\
%& \cong& (((\relsem{\vdash \tau} \rho \times
%\rho\beta) \to \rho\beta) \times \rho\beta) \to \rho\beta 
%\end{array}\]
%
%Since
%\[\begin{array}{rl}
% & \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset}
%  (\Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet + \tau \times \beta)\, \beta)\, \beta} \rho\\  
%=& \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet +
%  \tau \times \beta)\, \beta} \rho \to \rho\beta \\ 
%=& (\relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \onet + \tau \times \beta}
%\rho \to \rho\beta) \to \rho\beta \\ 
%=& ((\onet + \relsem{\vdash \tau} \rho \times
%\rho\beta) \to \rho\beta) \to \rho\beta \\ 
%\cong& (((\relsem{\vdash \tau} \rho \times
%\rho\beta) \to \rho\beta) \times \rho\beta) \to \rho\beta 
%\end{array}\]
%we have that
so if $(c', c) \in \relsem{\vdash F} \rho \times
\rho\beta \to \rho\beta$ and $(n', n) \in \rho\beta$ then
$(G \,(\pi_1 \rho)\, n'\, c', G\, (\pi_2 \rho)\, n\, c)
\in \rho \beta$.
In addition,
\[\setsem{\vdash \fold_{\onet + F
    \times \beta}^{H} : \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet
  + F \times H)\, H)\, (\Nat^{\emptyset} (\mu \alpha. \onet
  + F \times \alpha)\, H)} =
\mathit{fold}_{1 + \setsem{\vdash F} \times \_}\] so that if $c \in
\setsem{\vdash F} \,\times\, \setsem{\vdash H} \to
\setsem{\vdash H}$ and $n \in \setsem{\vdash H}$, then
$(n, c) \in \setsem{\vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\onet + F \times H)\,
  H}$. The instantiation
$\pi_1 \rho \beta = \setsem{\vdash \mu \alpha. \onet + F \times
  \alpha}=\mathit{List}\,\setsem{\vdash F}$,\, 
$\pi_2 \rho \beta = \setsem{\vdash H}$,\,
$\rho \beta = \graph{\mathit{fold}_{1 + \setsem{\vdash F} \times \_}\, n\, c} :
\rel(\pi_1 \rho \beta, \pi_2 \rho \beta)$,\,
$c' = \mathit{cons}$,\, and 
$n' = \mathit{nil}$
%Consider the instantiation:
%\[\begin{array}{rcl}
%\pi_1 \rho \beta &=& \setsem{\vdash \mu \alpha. \onet + \tau \times
%  \alpha} \;=\;\List\,\setsem{\vdash \tau}\\   
%\pi_2 \rho \beta &=& \setsem{\vdash \tau'}\\
%\rho \beta &=& \graph{\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\, c} :
%\rel(\pi_1 \rho \beta, \pi_2 \rho \beta) \\ 
%c' &=& \mathit{cons}\\
%n' &=& \mathit{nil}
%\end{array}\]
%Clearly, $(\mathit{nil}, n) \in \rho\beta =
%\graph{\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\, c}$ because $
%\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\, c \,\mathit{nil} = n$.  Moreover,
%$(\mathit{cons}, c) \in \relsem{\vdash \tau} \,\times\, \rho\beta \to
%\rho\beta$ since if $(x, x') \in \relsem{\vdash \tau}$, i.e., $x =
%x'$, and if $(y, y') \in \rho\beta =
%\graph{\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_} n\, c}$, i.e., $y' =
%\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_} n\, c\, y$, then
%\[(\mathit{cons}\, x\, y, c\, x\, (\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\,
%c\, y)) \in \graph{\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\, c}\]
%i.e.,
%\[c\, x\, (\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\, c\, y)
%= \mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}\, n\, c\, (\mathit{cons} \,x\, y)\]
%holds by definition of $\mathit{fold}_{1 + \tau \times \_}$.  We
%therefore conclude that
thus gives that $(G \;(\mathit{List}\,\setsem{\vdash
  F})\,\mathit{nil} \,\mathit{cons}, G \,\setsem{\vdash H} \,
n\, c) \in \graph{\mathit{fold}_{1 + \setsem{\vdash F} \times \_}\, n\, c}$, i.e.,
that $\mathit{fold}_{1 + \setsem{\vdash F} \times \_}\, n\, c\; (G\;
(\mathit{List}\,\setsem{\vdash F})\, \mathit{nil}\, \mathit{cons})
= G \,\setsem{\vdash H}\, n\, c$.
\end{proof}

We can extend short cut fusion results to arbitrary ADTs, as
in~\cite{joh02,pit98}.

\subsection{Short Cut Fusion for Arbitrary ADTs}\label{sec:short-cut-adt}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\ol{\vdash \tau}$, let $\vdash \tau'$, let $\ol{\alpha}; \beta
\vdash F$, and let $\beta; \emptyset  \,|\,
\emptyset \vdash g : \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset} F[\ol{\alpha
    := \tau}]\, \beta)\, \beta$.  If we regard
\[\begin{array}{lll}
H & = & \setsem{\emptyset;\beta \vdash F[\ol{\alpha :=
      \tau}]}\\
G & = & \setsem{\beta; \emptyset \,|\, \emptyset \vdash g :
  \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset}\, F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]\,
  \beta)\, \beta}
\end{array}\]
as functors in $\beta$, then for every $B \in H \setsem{\vdash \tau'}
\rightarrow \setsem{\vdash \tau'}$ we have
\[\mathit{fold}_H\, B \; (G\; \mu H \; in_H) = G \,\setsem{\vdash \tau'}\, B\]
\end{theorem}

\vspace*{0.2in}

\begin{proof}
  We first note that the type of $g$ is well-formed, since
  $\emptyset;\beta \vdash F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]$ so our
  promotion theorem gives that $\beta;\emptyset\vdash F[\ol{\alpha :=
      \tau}]$, and $\emptyset;\beta\vdash\beta$ so that our
  promotion theorem gives $\beta;\emptyset\vdash\beta$. From
  these facts we deduce that $\beta;\emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^\emptyset\,F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]\,\beta : \T$, and thus that
  $\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset}
  F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]\, \beta)\, \beta : \T$.

  Theorem~\ref{thm:abstraction} gives that, for any $\rho : \relenv$
  and any $(a, b) \in \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \emptyset}\rho =
  1$, eliding the only possible instantiations of $a$ and $b$ gives
  that
\[(G \,(\pi_1 \rho), G\, (\pi_2 \rho))
\in \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^{\emptyset}
  F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]\, \beta)\, \beta} \rho\]
Since
\[\begin{array}{rl}
 & \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset}
  (\Nat^{\emptyset} F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]\, \beta)\, \beta} \rho\\  
=& \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\ol{\alpha :=
      \tau}] \, \beta} \rho \to \rho\beta \\ 
\end{array}\]
we have that if $(A, B) \in \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}] \, \beta} \rho$
then
\[(G \,(\pi_1 \rho)\, A, G\, (\pi_2 \rho)\, B)
\in \rho \beta\]
Now note that
\[\setsem{\vdash \fold_{F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}^{\tau'} :
  \Nat^{\emptyset}\, (\Nat^{\emptyset}\, F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}][\beta
    := \tau'] \, \tau')\, (\Nat^{\emptyset} \,(\mu
  \beta. F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}] \, \tau')} =
\mathit{fold}_H\]
and consider the instantiation
\[\begin{array}{lll}
A &=& \mathit{in}_H :  H (\mu H) \to \mu H\\
B & : & H\setsem{\vdash \tau'} \to \setsem{\vdash \tau'}\\
\rho \beta &=& \graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}
\end{array}\]
(Note that all the types here are well-formed.)  This gives
\[\begin{array}{lll}
\pi_1 \rho \beta &=& \setsem{\vdash \mu \beta. F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}
\; = \; \mu H\\
\pi_2 \rho \beta &=& \setsem{\vdash \tau'}\\
\rho \beta &:& \rel(\pi_1 \rho \beta, \pi_2 \rho \beta)\\
A & : & \setsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset}
  F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}] \, \beta} (\pi_1 \rho)\\
B & : & \setsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\ol{\alpha
      := \tau}] \, \beta}(\pi_2 \rho)\\
\end{array}\]
since
\[\begin{array}{lll}
A \; = \; \mathit{in}_H & : & H(\mu H) \to \mu H\\
 & = & \setsem{\emptyset;\beta \vdash F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}(\mu
\setsem{\emptyset;\beta \vdash F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}) \to \mu
\setsem{\emptyset;\beta \vdash F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}]}\\
& = & \setsem{\emptyset;\beta \vdash F[\ol{\alpha :=
      \tau}]}(\pi_1\rho) \to \setsem{\emptyset;\beta \vdash
  \beta}(\pi_1 \rho)\\
& = & \setsem{\beta;\emptyset \vdash F[\ol{\alpha :=
      \tau}]}(\pi_1\rho) \to \setsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash
  \beta}(\pi_1 \rho) \hspace*{0.25in} {\color{red} \mbox{Daniel's
    trick; now a theorem}} \\ 
& = & \setsem{\beta;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\emptyset F[\ol{\alpha :=
      \tau}]\,\beta}(\pi_1 \rho) 
\end{array}\]
{\color{red} where ``Daniel's trick'' is the observation that a
  functor can be seen as non-functorial when we only care about its
  action on objects. This is now a theorem.}  We also have
\[\begin{array}{lll}
(A,B) \,=\, (\mathit{in}_H,B) & \in & \relsem{\beta; \emptyset \vdash
  \Nat^{\emptyset} F[\ol{\alpha := \tau}] \, \beta} \rho \\

Since $\beta$ is the only free variable in $G$, this simplifies to

\subsection{Short Cut Fusion for Arbitrary Nested
  Types}\label{sec:short-cut-nested} 

%fold/build rule shows that Church encodings for nested types are iso
%(have the same interp) as the nested types themselves. Just like Ex
%2.8 in parpoe, but categorical rather than operational semantics. But
%built-in data types are more versatile in implementations. They can be
%inducted on, e.g. And they are stored in the heap, not the run-time
%stack, and are therefore more efficient.
%``Most higher order type languages meant for human programmers eschew
%fully impredicative polymorphism'' says Andy on p322.

We can extend short cut fusion for lists~\cite{glp93} to nested
types, thereby
%We can also, finally,
formally prove correctness of the categorically
inspired
%short cut fusion for nested types
theorem from~\cite{jg10}.
We have:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:short-cut-nested}
If $\emptyset;\phi,\alpha \vdash F$, \,$\emptyset; \alpha
\vdash K$, \,
%let $\phi ;\emptyset\,|\,\emptyset\vdash g :
%\Nat^\emptyset\,(\Nat^\alpha\,F\,(\phi\alpha)) \,
%(\Nat^\alpha\,\onet \, (\phi\alpha))$. If we let
$H : [\set,\set] \to [\set,\set]$ is defined by
\[\begin{array}{lll}
H\,f\,x & = & \setsem{\emptyset; \phi, \alpha \vdash F}[\phi :=
  f][\alpha := x]\\
\end{array}\]
and 
\[G = \setsem{\phi;\emptyset\,|\,\emptyset \vdash g :
\Nat^\emptyset\,(\Nat^\alpha\,F\,(\phi\alpha))\,(\Nat^\alpha\,\onet \,
(\phi\alpha))}\] for some $g$, then, for every $B \in H
\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha \vdash K} \rightarrow \setsem{\emptyset;
  \alpha \vdash K}$,
$\mathit{fold}_{H}\, B \, (G\; \mu H \; \mathit{in}_{H}) = G
\,\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha \vdash K}\, B$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
%We first note that the type of $g$ is well-formed since
%$\emptyset;\phi,\alpha \vdash F : \F$ so our promotion theorem gives
%that $\phi;\alpha \vdash F : \F$, and $\phi;\alpha \vdash \phi\alpha :
%\F$, so that $\phi;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,(\phi\alpha) : \T$
%and $\phi;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha \onet \,(\phi\alpha) : \T$.
%Then $\phi;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,(\phi\alpha) : \F$ and
%$\phi;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha \onet \,(\phi\alpha) : \F$ also
%%%hold, and, finally, 
%$\phi ;\emptyset\vdash 
%\Nat^\emptyset\,(\Nat^\alpha\,F\,(\phi\alpha)) \,
%(\Nat^\alpha\,\onet \, (\phi\alpha)) : \T$
%  
Theorem~\ref{thm:abstraction} gives that, for any 
$\rho : \relenv$,
%and any $(a, b) \in \relsem{\phi,\alpha;\emptyset \vdash
%  \emptyset}\rho = 1$, eliding the only possible instantiations
%of $a$ and $b$ gives that
\[\begin{array}{lll}
(G \,(\pi_1 \rho), G\, (\pi_2 \rho))
& \in & \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash \Nat^{\emptyset} (\Nat^\alpha
  F\, (\phi\alpha))\, (\Nat^\alpha\,\onet \, (\phi\alpha))}
\rho\\ 
& = & \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,
  (\phi\alpha)}\rho \to \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash
  \Nat^\alpha\,\onet \, (\phi\alpha)}\rho\\ 
%& = & \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,
%  (\phi\alpha)}\rho \to (\,\lambda A. 1 \Rightarrow \lambda A.\,(\rho
%\phi) A\,)\\   
%& = & \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,
%  (\phi\alpha)}\rho \to (1 \Rightarrow \rho \phi)\\ 
& = & \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,
  (\phi\alpha)}\rho \to \rho \phi
\end{array}\]
\noindent
so if $(A, B) \in \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash \Nat^\alpha F\,
  (\phi\alpha)}\rho$ then $(G \,(\pi_1 \rho)\, A, G\, (\pi_2 \rho)\,
B) \in \rho \phi$.
Also,
%$\mathit{fold}_H = \setsem{\vdash \fold_F^K :
%  \Nat^{\emptyset}\, (\Nat^\alpha F[\phi := K]\,K)\, (\Nat^\alpha
%  ((\mu \phi.\lambda\alpha.F)\alpha)\,K)}$.
\[\setsem{\vdash \fold_F^K :
  \Nat^{\emptyset}\, (\Nat^\alpha F[\phi := K]\,K)\, (\Nat^\alpha
  ((\mu \phi.\lambda\alpha.F)\alpha)\,K)} = \mathit{fold}_H\]
Consider the instantiation $A = \mathit{in}_H : H (\mu H) \Rightarrow
\mu H$,\, $B : H\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha\vdash K} \Rightarrow
\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha \vdash K}$,\, $\rho \phi =
\graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}$,\, $\pi_1 \rho \phi = \mu H$,\, $\pi_2
\rho \phi = \setsem{\emptyset;\alpha\vdash K}$,\, $\rho \phi :
\rel(\pi_1 \rho \phi, \pi_2 \rho \phi)$,\, $A : \setsem{\phi;
  \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha F \, (\phi \alpha)} (\pi_1 \rho)$,\,
and $B : \setsem{\phi; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha F \, (\phi
  \alpha)} (\pi_2 \rho)$.
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
%A &=& \mathit{in}_H :  H (\mu H) \Rightarrow \mu H\\
%B & : & H\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha\vdash K} \Rightarrow
%\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha \vdash K}\\
%\rho \phi &=& \graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B} \hspace*{0.2in} {
%  \color{red} \mbox{a graph of a natural transformation, defined in
%    Enrico's notes}} 
%\end{array}\]
%(Note that all the types here are well-formed.) This gives
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
%\pi_1 \rho \phi &=& \mu H\\
%\pi_2 \rho \phi &=& \setsem{\emptyset;\alpha\vdash K}\\
%\rho \phi &:& \rel(\pi_1 \rho \phi, \pi_2 \rho \phi)\\
%A & : & \setsem{\phi; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha
%  F \, (\phi \alpha)} (\pi_1 \rho)\\
%B & : & \setsem{\phi; \emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha
%  F \, (\phi \alpha)} (\pi_2 \rho)\\
%\end{array}\]
%since
Equation~\ref{thm:demotion-objects} ensures that $A = \mathit{in}_H :
H(\mu H) \Rightarrow \mu H = \setsem{\phi;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha
  F \,(\phi\alpha)}(\pi_1\rho)$,
%\[\begin{array}{lll}
%A \; = \; \mathit{in}_H & : & H(\mu H) \Rightarrow \mu H\\

%  \setsem{\emptyset; \phi, \alpha \vdash F}\\  
%& = & \setsem{\emptyset; \phi, \alpha \vdash F}(\pi_1\rho)
%  \Rightarrow \setsem{\emptyset; \phi,\alpha \vdash \phi\alpha}(\pi_1 \rho)\\
%& = & \setsem{\phi; \alpha \vdash F}(\pi_1\rho)

%& = & \setsem{\phi;\emptyset \vdash \Nat^\alpha F
%    \,(\phi\alpha)}(\pi_1\rho) 
%\end{array}\]
and Equation~\ref{thm:demotion-objects} and Lemma~\ref{lem:graph}
together give that
\[\begin{array}{lll}
(A,B) \,=\, (\mathit{in}_H,B) & \in & \relsem{\phi;\emptyset\vdash

& = & \lambda A. \relsem{\phi;\alpha\vdash F}[\phi :=
  \graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}][\alpha := A] \Rightarrow 
 \graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B} \\ 
%& = & \lambda A. \relsem{\emptyset;\phi,\alpha\vdash F}[\phi :=
%  \graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}][\alpha := A] \Rightarrow 
%\graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}  \hspace*{0.25in} {\color{red}
%  \mbox{Daniel's trick; now a theorem}}\\  
& = & \relsem{\emptyset;\phi,\alpha\vdash F}

%\hspace*{0.25in} {\color{red} \mbox{Graph Lemma}}\\
  & = & \graph{\mathit{map}_H \,(\mathit{fold}_H\,B)} \Rightarrow
\graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}\\
\end{array}\]
since if $(x,y) \in \graph{\mathit{map}_H \,(\mathit{fold}_H\,B)}$,
%i.e., if $\mathit{map}_H \,(\mathit{fold}_H\,B) \, x = y$,
then $\mathit{fold}_H\, B\, (\mathit{in}_H\,x) = B\,y = B\,
(\mathit{map}_H \,(\mathit{fold}_H\,B) \, x)$ by the definition of
$\mathit{fold}_H$ as a (indeed, the unique) morphism from
$\mathit{in}_H$ to $B$.  Thus, $(G \,(\pi_1 \rho)\, A, G\, (\pi_2
\rho)\, B) \in \graph{\mathit{fold}_H\, B}$, i.e., $\mathit{fold}_H \,
B \, (G\, (\pi_1 \rho) \, \mathit{in}_H) = G\,(\pi_2 \rho)\,B$.  But
since $\phi$ is the only free variable in $G$, this simplifies to
$\mathit{fold}_H\, B \, (G\, \mu H\, \mathit{in}_H) =
G\,\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha\vdash K}\,B$. 
\end{proof}

\vspace*{-0.08in}

As in~\cite{jg10}, replacing $\onet$ with any type $\emptyset;\alpha
\vdash C$ generalizes
%with $\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha \vdash c}\rho = C$
Theorem~\ref{thm:short-cut-nested} to deliver more general a free
theorem whose conclusion is $\mathit{fold}_{H}\, B \; \circ \; G\; \mu
H \; \mathit{in}_{H} = G \,\setsem{\emptyset;\alpha \vdash K}\, B$.
Although it is standard to prove that the parametric model constructed
verifies the existence of initial algebras, this is unnecessary here
since initial algebras are built directly into our model.

\section{Conclusion and Directions for Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have constructed a parametric model for a calculus
providing primitives for constructing nested types directly as
fixpoints.
%rather than representing them via their Church encodings. We
We have also used the Abstraction Theorem for this model to derive
free theorems in the presence of nested types. This was not possible
before~\cite{jp19} because the nested types in our calculus were not
previously known to have well-defined interpretations in locally
finitely presentable categories like $\set$ and $\rel$. No calculus
for terms of these types existed, either. The key to our parametric
model is
%{\color{blue} adjusting our type syntax to respect the accessibility
%  cardinal for the semantic category and}
the delicate threading of functoriality and 
naturality conditions throughout its construction.

Even when nested types have well-defined interpretations in a semantic
category, the types of standard functions over them may not. This is
because all recursion in our calculus must be coded using standard
folds.  Since folds for nested types can only express computations
that return natural transformations, their expressivity has long been
a vexing issue, and this is naturally inherited by our calculus.
%indeed, such folds
%Our calculus naturally inherits these constraints.
%Of course our calculus inherits the constraints
%standard folds for nested types impose, and thus is perhaps not as
%expressive as we would ideally like.
In addition, while there are many papers on higher-kinded types, we
know of none that considers expressibility issues arising from the
local $\lambda$-presentability cardinal $\lambda$ of the categories in
which higher-kinded types are interpreted. Because $\lambda = \omega$
for $\set$ and $\rel$, the expressivity of our
%$\set$/$\rel$-based parametric model
calculus is, unfortunately, not easily improved there. Construction of
a $\set$/$\rel$-based parametric model for our calculus is
nevertheless worthwhile.  For one thing, the expressivity issue is
orthogonal to constructing parametric models,
%in the presence of nested types built from primitives,
and trying to address both in a single paper would
detract from the conceptual clarity of our model construction.
%our current focus on deriving principled parametricity
%results for practical programming languages, such as Haskell and Agda,
%that directly construct nested types as fixpoints.
%
%conceptual clarity of this paper.
For another, if the construction in this paper
%we couldn't
%construct a $\set$/$\rel$-based parametric model for the calculus
%presented here,
weren't possible, then trying to construct a parametric model from
richer semantic categories for fancier data types and/or recursion
schemes would be futile. We naturally expect the construction reported
here to guide its generalization to the locally $\lambda$-presentable
categories for $\lambda > \omega$ that will be needed to accommodate
more general data types and recursion schemes for them.

% As is, the results reported here provide a
%blueprint for deriving principled parametricity results for practical
%programming languages, such as Haskell and Agda, that directly
%construct nested types as fixpoints.

%{\color{blue} Perhaps surprisingly, the accessibility cardinal
%$\omega$ for the semantic categories $\set$ and $\rel$ also impacts
%the types of functions (and thus the functions themselves), even over
%expressible data types, that can be expressed. Although there are
%many papers on higher-kinded types, no other work that we know of
%even considers expressibility issues resulting from the semantic
%settings in which they are interpreted.}
%{\color{blue} In light of the aforementioned
%  restrictions imposed by the accessibility cardinal of $\set$ and
%  $\rel$, this paper is perhaps best read as a proof-of-concept for
%  constructing parametric models in the locally finitely presentable
%  categories $\set$ and $\rel$ for calculi that construct nested types
%  and other advanced data types as fixed points (rather than
%  representing them via their Church encodings) and that support
%  structured recursion over them. If we couldn't construct such a
%  model even in this restricted setting, then there'd be no point in
%  trying to do so for more robust categories, data types, and/or
%  recursion schemes. Moreover, our constructions in this simplest
%  possible setting will guide their generalizations to the locally
%  $\lambda$-presentable categories fopr $\lambda > \omega$ required to
%  handle more general data types, structured recursive functions over
%  then, and more general fixpoints.}



%But since this expressivity issue is orthogonal to constructing
%parametric models in the presence of nested types built from
%primitives, and since it would detract from the conceptual clarity of
%our presentation, we have deliberately chosen not to address it in
%this paper. (However, we discuss some ideas for increasing
%expressivity in the next paragraph.) Despite the limitations of
%standard folds, our results provide a blueprint for deriving
%principled parametricity results for practical programming languages,
%such as Haskell and Agda, that directly construct nested types as
%fixpoints.



%All recursion in our calculus must be coded using folds. Expressivity

standard folds in the presence of object-level {\em right} Kan
extensions.
%; interpreting such

object-level {\em left} Kan extensions, and
%
%This suggests

%{\color{blue} We may need to impose restrictions inspired
%  by those for $\mu$-types on LKEs.}
adding a carefully designed left Kan extension construct to our
calculus was shown in~\cite{jp19} to preserve the cocontinuity needed
for GADTs to have well-defined interpretations. (Note, however, that
%not necessarily in
%However, this will not, in general, be
%the case in locally finitely presentable categories. Indeed, as shown
%in~\cite{jp19},
locally $\lambda$-presentable categories for $\lambda > \aleph_1$ are
required to interpret even commonly used GADTs.) This suggests
extending our calculus with Kan extension constructs and
%augmenting our type formation rules with such a construct.
%The constructions of this paper should all be possible
carrying out our model construction in a locally $\lambda$-presentable
cartesian closed category (lpccc) $\cal C$ whose category of
(abstract) relations, obtained by pullback as in~\cite{jac99},
is also a lpccc and appropriately fibred over $\cal C$.  This would
%extend the results presented here along the lines of~\cite{gjfor15},
%thus giving
give a framework for constructing parametric models for calculi
with nested types built from primitives that is based on locally
$\lambda$-presentable fibrations, for some appropriate definition
thereof.  Another option is to add term-level fixpoints
%, as in~\cite{pit00},
to the calculus presented here. Of course, this would require the
categories interpreting types to be not just locally
$\lambda$-presentable, but to support some kind of domain structure as
well.
%Unfortunately, $\omega$-CPO, the most obvious category
%of domains to replace $\set$, is not locally finitely presentable.

fixpoints at term level ala Pitts:

I'm not sure if we actually want to do this or not (because not all
fixpoints will necessarily exist, and this will have consequences, and
because of the restriction to strict functions it will entail and the
fact that I haven't yet thought about how those will thread through
our calculus), but another idea we might consider is adding fixpoints
at the term level. This is done for System F in Wadler's section
7. [It is also done in Pitts' Parametric Polymorphism and Operational
  Equivalence paper, where the term introduction rule is SEE SOURCE

%Gamma \vdash F : \tau \to \tau
%-------------------------------
%Gamma \vdash fix (F) : tau

But of course the model there is entirely operational rather than
categorical.]


On the other hand, check out the last paragraph of Wadler's paper, which
suggests that (at least in 1989) there was some interest in calculi like
ours:

"The desire to derive theorems from types therefore suggests that it would be
valuable to explore programming languages that prohibit recursion or only
allow its restricted use. In theory, this is well understood; we have already
noted that any computable function that is provably total in second-order
Peano arithmetic can be defined in the pure polymorphic lambda calculus,
without using the fixpoint as a primitive. However, practical languages based
on this notion remain terra incognita."

Of course we are not working in System F, but perhaps the same desire applies
here, and we do get the same kinds of theorems as Wadler, many just as a
consequence of our interpretation, without invoking parametricity.

In any case, I guess Wadler could be cited as justifying restricting
our attention to our calculus since it could be seen as a way to have
a practical language that ensures that all programs are
terminating. This has been considered in the past, e.g., in ADL,
Charity, PolyP.


TERMINATING RECURSION
Another possible solution to the expressivity issue is extend folds to
track of deep structure of nested types as in~\cite{jp19}, so that
specialization of fixpoint can be computed as fixpoint of
specialization.

Add more polymorphism (all foralls), even though most free theorems
only use one level (or maybe two, like short cut).
